The Banting Lectures  are a yearly series of research presentations given by an expert in diabetes. The name of the lecture series refers to Canadian physician Sir Frederick Banting, who was a seminal scientist, doctor and Nobel laureate for the co-discovery of insulin. The lectures are currently hosted by the American Diabetes Association.
