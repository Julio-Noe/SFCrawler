Random glucose test (a.k.a. random blood glucose) is a blood sugar test taken from a non-fasting subject.
This test, also called capillary blood glucose (CBG), assumes a recent meal and therefore has higher reference values than the fasting glucose test.


== Reference values ==
The reference values for a "normal" random glucose test in an average adult are 79–140mg/dl (4.4–7.8 mmol/l), between 140-200mg/dl (7.8–11.1 mmol/l) is considered pre-diabetes, and ≥ 200 mg/dl is considered diabetes according to ADA guidelines (you should visit your doctor or a clinic for additional tests however as a random glucose of > 160mg/dl does not necessarily mean you are diabetic).
