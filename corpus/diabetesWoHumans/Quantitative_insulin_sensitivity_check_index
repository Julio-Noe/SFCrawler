The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) is derived using the inverse of the sum of the logarithms of the fasting insulin and fasting glucose:

1 / (log(fasting insulin Î¼U/mL) + log(fasting glucose mg/dL))This index correlates well with glucose clamp studies (r = 0.78), and is useful for measuring insulin sensitivity (IS), which is the inverse of insulin resistance (IR). It has the advantage of that it can be obtained from a fasting blood sample, and is the preferred method for certain types of clinical research.

Values typically associated with the QUICKI calculation for insulin resistance in humans fall broadly within a range between 0.45 for unusually healthy individuals and 0.30 in diabetics.  So lower numbers reflect greater insulin resistance.
