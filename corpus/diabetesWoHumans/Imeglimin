Imeglimin is an experimental drug being developed as an oral anti-diabetic. It is an oxidative phosphorylation blocker that acts to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, increase muscle glucose uptake, and restore normal insulin secretion. It will be the first of a new class of anti-diabetic if it is approved.
