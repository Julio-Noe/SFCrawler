The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to diabetes mellitus (diabetes insipidus not included below) :
Diabetes mellitus – group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond properly to the insulin that is produced, a condition called insulin resistance. The resultant high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger).


== What type of thing is diabetes mellitus? ==
Diabetes can be described as a:

A class of metabolic diseases
A class of systemic diseases


== Types of diabetes mellitus ==
Prediabetes  (mellitus–
Main types of diabetes:
Diabetes mellitus type 1 – disease that results in autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 – metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.Disease of affluence – type 2 diabetes is one of the "diseases of affluence", which include mostly chronic non-communicable diseases for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be important risk factors.
Gestational diabetes – Gestational diabetes, is a temporary condition that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. Like type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes causes blood sugar levels to become too high. It involves an increased risk of developing diabetes for both mother and child.Other types of diabetes:
Congenital diabetes –
Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes –
Steroid diabetes –
Monogenic diabetes –


== Signs and symptoms of diabetes ==

== Preventing diabetes ==


=== Preventing diabetes mellitus type 1 ===
Currently, there is no known way to prevent diabetes mellitus type 1.


=== Preventing diabetes mellitus type 2 ===
Preventing diabetes mellitus type 2 – entails a lifestyle with a routine, regime, or self care program that includes the following:

Maintaining a healthy weight –
Proper nutrition –
Regular physical exercise – in addition to helping to maintain a healthy weight, sufficient vigorous physical exercise increases cells' sensitivity to insulin, and can thus prevent and possibly revert insulin resistance.
Medication – specific medications have been shown to be able to prevent type 2 diabetes. However, the disease can often be delayed through proper nutrition and regular exercise.
