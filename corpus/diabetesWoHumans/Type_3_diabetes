Type 3 diabetes is a proposed term for Alzheimer's disease resulting from insulin resistance (which is the primary problem associated with type 2 diabetes) and insulin deficiency (which the primary problem in type 1 diabetes). The categorization is not embraced by the medical community.
A limited number of published reviews have suggested mechanisms linking Alzheimer's and insulin resistance.  In Alzheimer's disease, the brains ability to metabolize sugar efficiently is decreased. Neurofibrillary tangles and hyper phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.  Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) plays a key role in the formation of the neurofibrillary tangles.
