== History ==
After starting a mail-order diabetes supply business in 1989, the company realized that customers needed information as well as supplies. Soon “Diabetes on the Dial,” a radio show featuring interviews of world-class experts in the field of diabetes, was born. The demand for transcripts of the broadcasts lead to the company publishing a monthly magazine, originally named Diabetes Interview, now named Diabetes Health.
