The Betsy Riot is a radical left group that describes itself as a "decentralized neo-suffragette, punk-patriot resistance movement." They are pro-gun control. The group began in August 2016, primarily with an anti-gun industry focus, but since the 2016 presidential election, has broadened its focus to protest Trump administration policies. The group uses profanity, satire and a radical feminist posture in its messaging, with tactics that include graffiti, theatrical protests, pranks, and coordinated messaging actions, such as mailings, banners, and flyers. The group has also encouraged petty vandalism to further their agenda.
As part of an ongoing demonstration against gun rights advocates, Betsy Riot purchased johnlott.com (John Lott) and waynelapierre.com (Wayne LaPierre) and runs them as parody sites.
