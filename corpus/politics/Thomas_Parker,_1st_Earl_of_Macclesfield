Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield,  (23 July 1666 – 28 April 1732) was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1705 to 1710. He was Lord Chief Justice from 1710 to 1718 and acted briefly as one of the  regents before the arrival of King George I in Britain. His career ended when he was convicted of corruption on a massive scale and he spent the later years of his life in detention.


== Early life ==
Parker was born in Staffordshire, the son of Thomas Parker, an attorney at Leek and his wife Anne Venables, daughter of Robert Venables of Nuneham, Cheshire. He was educated at Adams' Grammar School at Newport, Shropshire, Derby School in 1680 and at Rev. Samuel Ogden’s school at Derby. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1684 and at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1685. On 23 April 1691, he married   Janet Carrier, whose sister was married to William Anson, 1st Baron Anson's father. He was called to the bar in 1694.


== Political career ==
Parker was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Derby at the 1705 English general election and was appointed QC and serjeant-at-law and knighted on 9 July 1705. He was returned unopposed for Derby at the 1708 British general election. Like other Whigs, he voted for the general naturalization of foreign Protestants in 1709. Being one of the leading Whig lawyers in the House of Commons, he was deeply involved in the moves to impeach  Dr Sacheverell. He was appointed to the committee  to draw up the articles of impeachment on 14 December 1709. The committee was later given the management of the trial.  In 1710 he refused the office of  Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, but was made a Privy Counsellor. The office of Lord Chief Justice fell vacant in 1710 and the administration wanted a quick replacement. Parker was appointed on 11 March 1710 and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. 


== Lord Chief Justice ==

From 1710 to 1718 Parker was involved in the prosecution of Dr Sacheverell. He made a vehement attack on Sacheverell and the high church clergy. He defended Whig propagandists and harried Tory publicists, including Defoe and Swift, on the slightest suspicion of favouring the Pretender. He spoke against the peace in the Privy Council in April 1713. In June 1714 he was given evidence of the recruiting activity of Jacobite agents which resulted in a price being placed on the Pretender’s head.  On 1 August 1714, Queen Anne died, and her successor, King George I, was in Hanover, so Baron Parker was designated as one of the regents of Great Britain, Ireland and the realms beyond the seas until the new monarch arrived in Britain.   His support for the Hanoverian succession was appreciated by King George I who reappointed him lord chief justice in 1714, and raised him to the peerage as Baron Parker of Macclesfield in 1716. In 1718, because the King could not speak English, Parker gave the King's Speech in the House of Lords.


== Lord Chancellor ==
In 1718, Parker became Lord Chancellor, and was given a pension for life.  In 1721, he was advanced to the title Earl of Macclesfield with the additional subsidiary title of Viscount Parker. 


== Impeachment ==
In 1724, Parker was implicated in financial irregularities, but he did not resign as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain until 1725. In 1725, he was impeached and tried in the House of Lords.  He was, unanimously, convicted of corruption for taking more than £100,000 in bribes (the equivalent of more than £11,000,000 today). He was fined £30,000 and placed in the Tower of London until payment was received. He was also struck off the roll of the Privy Council. He was a fabulously wealthy man, possibly because of his corruption, but as this money was confiscated, he had no resources to pay his fine. He spent most of the rest of his life at Shirburn Castle. He died in Soho Square, London on 28 April 1732 and was buried at Shirburn.Parker became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1713. He was also a friend of Bernard de Mandeville, whose satirical Fable of the Bees became highly controversial in the 1720s. He   had a grammar school built at Leek, his home town. He was, however,   a pallbearer at the funeral of Sir Isaac Newton in 1727.
