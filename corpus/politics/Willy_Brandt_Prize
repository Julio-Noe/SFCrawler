The Willy Brandt Prize is an annual prize awarded by the Norwegian-German Willy Brandt prize foundation (in German: Norwegisch-Deutsche Willy-Brandt-Stiftung) since 2000. It is awarded to persons or institutions that make significant contributions to German-Norwegian relations. It is named after the former German Bundeskanzler Willy Brandt and comprises a Willy Brandt statuette by Nils Aas and a certificate. It is separate from the International Willy-Brandt Prize founded in 2011 by the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
