The President of the Council of Ministers of Peru, informally called "Premier" (form of address) or "Prime Minister", heads the Council of Ministers, and is appointed by the President (pending ratification by Congress as with all members of the Council).
The Prime Minister of Peru is, however, not the head of government, since in Peru the President is the one who serves as the actual head of government. Peru is one of the few countries in Latin America (others are Argentina, Cuba and Haiti) where the position of prime minister currently exists. The current spot for Prime Minister has been filled by Vicente Zeballos, a Minister of Justice, following the resignation of the 151st Prime Minister, César Villanueva, who took office on 2 April 2018.


== Reform ==
Recently, the role of the prime minister has been debated, and whether it should be strengthened. This idea has been supported by former presidents Alan García, Alejandro Toledo and Ollanta Humala. Such reforms would enable the prime minister to become the effective head of government, similarly to what happens in countries like France and Russia.
