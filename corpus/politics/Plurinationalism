Plurinationality, plurinational, or plurinationalism is defined as the coexistence of two or more sealed or preserved national groups within a polity (an organized community or body of peoples).  Ecuadorian ex-President Rafael Correa defined plurinationalism as the coexistence of several different nationalities within a larger state where different peoples, cultures and worldviews exist and are recognized.  In plurinationalism, the idea of nationality is plural, meaning there are many nationals within an organized community or body of peoples.  Derived from this concept, a plurinational state is the existence of multiple political communities and constitutional asymmetry.  The usage of plurinationality assists in avoiding the division of societies within a state or country.  Furthermore, a plurinational democracy recognizes the multiple demoi (common people or populace) within a polity.
