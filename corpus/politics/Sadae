Sadae (lit. "serving-the-Great," Hangul: 사대 Hanja: 事大) is a neutral, non-pejorative Korean term which is used in pre-modern contexts.  The term is used as a descriptive label for bilateral foreign relations between Imperial China and Joseon dynasty Korea.  Sadae is also understood as relevant in understanding pre-Joseon diplomacy.


== Etymology ==
The historical term is derived from the Chinese shi da (Korean, sadae) as used by the philosopher Mencius. Sadae literally means "dealing with the great" or "serving the great."The neutral term is distinguished from the pejorative "sadaejuui", which was invented by early 20th century Korean nationalists.  The genesis of the term "sadae" arises in the work of the Chinese philosopher Mencius:

梁惠王下Mencius - Liang Hui Wang II


== Overview ==
Sadae describes a foreign policy characterized by the various ways a small country acknowledges the strength of a greater power like that of China. Sadae is made manifest in the actions of the weaker state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys.
The utility of the sadae concept in Korea was recognized from the period of Three Kingdoms of Korea to 1895; and it is demonstrated in the relationship of mid-Joseon Korea towards the Ming Dynasty of China. The Joseon Dynasty made every effort to maintain a friendly relationship with Beijing for reasons having to do with realpolitik and with an idealized Confucian worldview. Sadae construes China as the center of a Confucian moral universe.As a foundation of diplomacy, the Joseon kingdom presumed that the Korean state was positioned within a Sinocentristic milieu.  The Joseon foreign policy was organized around maintaining stable Joseon-Chinese relations in the period from 1392 through 1895. The concept of sadae is contrasted with limited trade relationships or kyorin diplomacy (교린정책; lit. "neighborly relations") which marked Joseon-Japanese relations in this period.


=== 20th century re-interpretation ===
The concept of sadae was rejected in the writings of polemicist Shin Chaeho and other Korean nationalists in the 20th century.  Shin is known for having argued that the sadae effectively functioned in two ways:

to devalue the ethnic origins of the Korean people and state
to subjugate Korean history within a Confucian interpretive frameworkHis revisionist writings sought to deny the relevance of sadae as an important element of Korean history.
