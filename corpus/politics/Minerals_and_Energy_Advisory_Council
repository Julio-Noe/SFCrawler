The Minerals and Energy Advisory Council is an entity which represents the interests of resources and energy companies to the Government of South Australia. It was formed in 2015 in a merger of the Resources Industry Development Board and the Resources and Energy Sector Infrastructure Council. It is in a partnership with the Olympic Dam Task Force. In 2016, the MEAC discussed the future use of small modular nuclear reactors in South Australia and the need to legalise their deployment. The MEAC also prepared a report on the findings of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission to present to Minister Tom Koutantonis.
