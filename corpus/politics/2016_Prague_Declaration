The Prague Declaration was a declaration released by a number of right-wing anti-Islam groupings after a meeting held in Roztoky, near Prague, Czech Republic on 23 January 2016. It was on an initiative by Lutz Bachmann, founder of Pegida.
The signatories to the declaration were Blok proti islámu, Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond, Lega Nord, Odvaha, Pegida Austria, Pegida Bulgaria, Pegida Germany, Pegida Netherlands, Ruch Narodowy and Úsvit - Národní Koalice. 
Those present signed the declaration known as the 2016 Prague Declaration calling in unison, "We are Fortress Europe," and then in German, "Wir sind Festung Europa."
