The 1978 Washington summit was the 5th NATO summit bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in Washington, D.C. took place on May 30â€“31, 1978.  This event was only the fifth meeting of the NATO heads of state following the ceremonial signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949.


== Background ==
In this period, the organization faced unresolved questions concerned whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.
