Eritrean nationalism is centered on the notion that the Eritreans share a common history, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. A notional basis for Eritrean nationalism initially seems lacking, due to the divergence in its demographics. Eritrea has nine major ethnic groups, each with their own language and culture and is evenly split between two major religions. However the Eritrean government seeks to foster Eritrean nationalism through programs such as national service programs, the promotion of liberal nationalism and curbing foreign influences.
