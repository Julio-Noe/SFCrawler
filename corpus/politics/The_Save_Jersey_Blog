The Save Jersey Blog is a conservative political blog focusing on New Jersey and national politics. It was founded by New Jersey political activist Matt Rooney in May 2008.
The blog's primary contributor and editor is Matt Rooney, whose self-proclaimed title is that of "Blogger-in-Chief." His co-bloggers include Alex Smith, Matt DeLuca, and a number of anonymous contributors including Zebulon Pike and Dino Crocetti. Stylistically, Save Jersey posts primarily satirical videos, interviews with political personalities and written analysis and commentary. The site's stated issues of interest are limited government, taxes and corruption, although the site's bloggers spent a considerable amount of time attacking former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine (D). Numerous posts and videos were devoted to lampooning the former Democratic governor.
During its first full year of operation, Save Jersey covered and commented on the heated N.J. GOP gubernatorial primary contest between rival candidates Chris Christie and Steve Lonegan. Save Jersey, and Matt Rooney specifically, emerged as early, vocal supporters of Christie's candidacy, a fact which enraged some conservatives who view Christie as a "Republican In Name Only" or a RINO. In April 2009, Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post's "The Fix" named Save Jersey one of the nation's top state political blogs.[1] Save Jersey's site traffic went on to exceed its other state-based competitors throughout the Summer of 2009.

On August 26, 2010, Matt Rooney left the blog to pursue unspecified "opportunities away from the political arena."[3] Editor Brian McGovern took over the site and relaunched the site in early 2010.
