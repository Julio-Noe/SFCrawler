Belarusian nationalism is the Belarusian version of nationalism. Belarusian nationalism is activated in times of weakening Russia's pressure on Belarus, as it was in the early 20th century, which resulted in the declaration of the Belarusian People's Republic, or at the end of the 20th century, which resulted in the proclamation of independence of the Republic of Belarus.
Today there is a number organizations with the ideological basis of Belarusian nationalism (BPF Party, the CCP BPF, etc.).
Belarusian nationalists support the abolition of the allied relations with Russia and the Russian language official status, strengthening the independence of the Belarusian state, the adoption of the national flag to the historic white-red-white flag and the coat of arms Pahonia, the rehabilitation of the Belarusian national identity since intense russification of Belarus in the 19-20th centuries.
