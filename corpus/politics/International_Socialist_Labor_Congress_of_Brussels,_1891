== Resolutions ==
The congress passed resolutions on the conditions of membership to the congress, international labor legislation, the Jewish question and the rights of women, the position of the working class regarding militarism, and strikes. It also proclaim May 1 a proletarian holiday.
The resolution on the Jewish question originally only condemned anti-Semitism, and stated the liberation of the Jews, as with every other people, would only be brought about by the advent of socialism. It was changed however, on the initiative of Dr. Regnard and M. Argyriades, of France, to condemn both anti-semitic and "philo-semitic" tyranny, noting that many Jewish financiers and banks were "great oppressors of labour".
