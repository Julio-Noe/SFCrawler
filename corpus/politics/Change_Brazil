Brazil Can Do More (Portuguese: O Brasil pode mais), renamed Change Brazil (Portuguese: Muda Brasil) as of 2014, was a centrist electoral coalition in Brazil formed around the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) for the 2010 presidential election. It was formed by six parties: PSDB, Democrats (DEM), Brazilian Labour Party (PTB), Socialist People's Party (PPS), Party of National Mobilization (PMN) and Labour Party of Brazil (PTdoB). Its presidential candidate was former São Paulo Governor José Serra from PSDB and the vice-presidential candidate was Rio de Janeiro federal deputy Indio da Costa from DEM.
On October 3, Serra was the second top voted candidate at the presidential election. Because the top voted candidate, Dilma Rousseff, was not able to get 50% of the unspoilt votes, she faced Serra in a run-off on October 31, which Rouseff won.
At the legislative election, the Brazil Can Do More coalition gained 136 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, as well as 25 out of 81 seats in the Federal Senate. This result was an all-time low for the lulist opposition. On the other hand, the center-left For Brazil to Keep on Changing coalition, which gathered around Lula's chosen successor Dilma Rousseff, reached an all-time high.
For the 2014 elections, the alliance changed its name to Change Brazil (Portuguese: Muda Brasil) and was led by Aécio Neves.
In 2017, Aécio Neves was forced to step down from the coalition leadership after he got involved in a series of corruption scandals including Operation Car Wash.The coalition was dissolved in 2018, with its parties supporting different candidates in the 2018 general election.
