Political positivism is a theory founded by Ljubisa Bojic (Serbian: Ljubiša Bojić). It includes intensive use of media to promote unity, participation, and positivism in thinking of common men and women.


== Short explanation ==
Gradual change of individuals results in a big alteration for the community as a whole. Psychology is the key to our success. On the other hand, various media can impact great masses of people. Until today, politicians used TV programs, press, and different kind of propaganda to trigger wars, stimulate hate and impose conflict between people. Optimistic thinking enables us to make the difference together.

He said, this proposition would be introduced to the international community at the Young Democratic Leaders Network summit in Istanbul (2007).
