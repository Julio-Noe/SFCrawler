Project 21 is a conservative public policy group. The organization refers to itself as "the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives." and started out as a blog to reclaim liberal African Americans at the grassroots level.
According to its website, Project 21 is "an initiative of the National Center for Public Policy Research to promote the views of African-Americans whose entrepreneurial spirit, dedication to family and commitment to individual responsibility has not traditionally been echoed by the nation's civil rights establishment."
Project 21's New Visions Commentaries have been distributed to more than 300 black newspapers across the United States and have usually been featured as guest columns or editorials.
