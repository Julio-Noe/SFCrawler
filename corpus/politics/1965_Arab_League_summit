According to Shlomo Gazit of Israeli intelligence, King Hassan II of Morocco invited Mossad and Shin Bet agents to bug the Casablanca hotel where the Arab League Summit would be held to record the conversations of the Arab leaders. This information was instrumental in Israel's major victory over Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six-Day War. According to Ronen Bergman, Mossad then supplied information leading to Mehdi Ben Barka's capture and assassination in October.
