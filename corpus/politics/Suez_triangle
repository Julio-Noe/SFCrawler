The Suez Triangle is a concept favoured in the political literature of the early 1980s Soviet Bloc. The theory held that the major world events of October 1956 were interconnected as a Western-funded conspiracy.
The theory postulates that the Hungarian anti-communist revolt was staged in Budapest on 23 October 1956 on command of the CIA, in order to divert Soviet attention from the joint Israeli-French-British naval invasion of Nasser's Egypt and the Suez Canal, as well as the simultaneous kidnapping of Algerian independence leader Ahmed Ben Bella, and subsequent purges in the French colonies in North Africa.
