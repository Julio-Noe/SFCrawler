The World Policy Conference (WPC) is an independent organization whose aim is to contribute to improving all aspects of governance, with a view to promoting a world that is more open, prosperous, fairer and more respectful of the diversity of States and nations. It was launched in 2008, by Thierry de Montbrial, President and Founder of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri).This annual conference revolves around debates gathering economic and political leaders, diplomats, representatives of civil society, experts and journalists from all over the world. It aims at reflecting, debating, and offering constructive solutions to major regional and international issues, in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance.In 2017, the World Policy Conference ranked 3rd best Think Tank Conference according to The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP) at the Lauder Institute, University of Pennsylvania '2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report'.


== History ==
Launched in 2008 by Thierry de Montbrial, the President and Founder of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), the World Policy Conference (WPC) is the first effort to foster systematic reflection on organizing global governance tailored to 21st century realities, bringing together the highest-level decision-makers, experts and opinion leaders.The first edition of the conference took place in Evian (France), from October 6–8, 2008.


== The foundations of the WPC ==
The World Policy Conference (WPC) was founded on three complementary ideas:- the nature of globalisation
The World Policy Conference falls within a context where globalisation and interconnections between countries have never been stronger, whether it is on a political, economic or environmental level. During its first edition in 2008, the conference has addressed the subprime crisis, which had just broken out in the United States and has spared no continents since then.
- International relations are still centered on relations between states
Despite phenomena of globalisation, the world is still organized around political entities, States. They are characterized by a territory, a population and a government. They also share common culture, values, institutions, and have delimited borders.
- The construction of the new international system – or rather of its governance – is not just a matter for states
In order to ensure good global governance, states must reform and cooperate. However, they cannot be the only ones to work to that end. NGOs and think tanks, including the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), have to take part in this process as well. Each member should be able to express his point of view and influence the choices made via a proper decision-making process. Finally, global institutions (UN), as well as regional (African Union, Arab League) and specialized institutions (IMF, World Bank, International Energy Agency, World Health Organization) have to adjust to the new global order and find adequate solutions.


== A centre of influence, thinking and debate ==
The three meeting formats – namely, the plenary sessions, workshops and lunch or dinner debates – are based on the concept of constructive public-private interaction at the highest level. During plenary sessions, each speaker has an exclusive and equal right to the floor, regardless of his home country’s status on the world stage.


== An informal meeting-place ==
Each participant is individually chosen on the basis of a range of criteria, such as regional, functional and media-related factors. The number of participants at each conference remains limited to ensure that meetings are as productive as possible. On this basis and in a warm and welcoming setting, all the conditions are met for participants to speak their mind freely, thereby creating a very high-level yet informal meeting-place.


== Conference follow-up ==
As the conference proceedings are intended to fuel public debate, they are largely “on the record” and widely disseminated.


=== Print publications ===
A report is published after each WPC conference. This report contains the most noteworthy excerpts from the presentations and the profiles of all the participants, as well as a description of all the WPC’s partners. Each conference’s highlights are illustrated with a large number of images. Thousands of copies of this bilingual (French-English) publication are distributed worldwide every year. The report can also be downloaded in PDF format from the WPC website.


=== Digital media ===
The WPC website provides access not only to all past conferences but also to the latest information on the forthcoming conference.
• WPC TV: WPC TV provides access to interviews with and statements by the participants in the conference.• Conference proceedings: The proceedings of each conference are published online, with all presentations entirely available in video and text formats.


=== Social networks and sharing ===
