Public Grievances Redressal is one of the flagship initiatives for the reformation in governance started by Central government through addressing the grievances of general public.
It was created in June 2007 by DARPG(Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances). Under the public grievance mechanism any citizen of India can raise their problems, grievance or pleas to the central govt and state government Ministries and Departments. Grievance can be submitted to all important portfolio ministers and Departments. The system has been designed in-house by the PMO team with the help of National Informatics Centre.It has a telephonic feedback feature also.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the supreme head of the public grievances. Jitendra singh is Currently the Minister for Independent Charge for grievances public personnel and pension Department and Sumita Dasgupta is its Deputy Secretary in charge.


== Low effectiveness ==
Despite the Prime Minister's efforts, the grievance redressal mechanism is said to be yet not effective since most grievances are either rejected, disposed or closed. The bureaucrats are said to dispose pleas and grievances without resolving or addressing the issue.Though government is taking effective measures to help people some of the bureaucrats in the system do not help in sound performance of these schemes.
An example of this could be seen on the case of slain right to information (RTI) activist Satish Shetty who was murdered in Talegaon Dabhade in Pune on 13 January 2010. Sandeep Shetty, brother of Satish Shetty, said that in July 2015, about a month-and-a-half ago, he had sent all details of the case to “pgportal.gov.in”, the official web portal for public grievances redressal. He said he got a reply saying “Your grievance has been registered vide registration number PMOPG/E/2015/0119691. Please quote the same in your future correspondence.”
“But There is no progress further”.
