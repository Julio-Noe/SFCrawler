The Electoral Headhunter (international) or Koppensneller (Dutch) is a special type of Voting Advice Application (VAA), providing a voting advice for several elections such as province and national elections in the Netherlands, the 2014 Dutch European Parliament Elections and for the Presidential elections of 2012 in the USA.


== Functionality ==
Opposite to most other VAAs, it claims to focus on intuition rather than 'objective' statements about the views of political parties. The person should 'trust [his] feeling', choosing between faces of politicians, selecting the ones that appeal to him the most. From the choices, several conclusions are made about the person's political viewpoints.


== No proof of claim ==
Although the scientific sources such as articles in the Scientific American named on the site may be correct, the Electoral Headhunter/Koppensneller does not give proof that a voting advice could be extracted from merely choosing 'appealing faces'.
