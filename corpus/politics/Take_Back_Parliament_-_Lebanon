Take Back Parliament - Lebanon  (Arabic: إسترجعوا البرلمان‎), (TBP - Lebanon) is a political movement launched by several Lebanese activists who met through various social organizations and civil initiatives. Social media has played a significant role in helping to expand the group. The grassroots campaign was created as an alternative to the gridlock between the two existing political alliances in Lebanon, the March 8 Alliance and March 14 Alliance. The group members crowd-sourced to build an electoral platform which is the ideal political agenda they would like to see candidates represent. The political agenda calls for a democratic secular nonsectarian government, bringing social justice awareness, and an eventual end to corruption.


== Values ==
- Practice that reflects Principles: TBP strives to reflect its values in its internal organizing. 
- Zero Budget: TBP did not hire any staff; the endeavor is completely dependent on volunteers. 
- Transparency: TBP only asks for donations to pay necessary fees and bills and has pledged to make its accounts and spendings transparent. 
- Direct Democracy: TBP promotes direct democracy as its internal way of organizing and as a viable democratic system for Lebanon. 
- Accountability: The campaign is built on open, honest, and friendly accountability mechanisms of individuals, groups, and decisions within the group.
- Grassroots Organizing: TBP members believe in a bottom-up approach to political change in Lebanon. They did not seek mainstream media campaigns and have announced knocking on doors and taking the time to speak to people individually.
- Faith in the Impossible: TBP members admit that their project might seem impossible but say that they have trust in the power of the people.


== Agenda ==
TBP was created to challenge what it calls the total inefficiency of the current and previous Lebanese parliaments and their disconnect from the daily lives of citizens. TBP members crowd-sourced and contacted various experts and NGOs to build agenda papers regarding the following issues:

Some of these papers are already available on the TBP website [10] and the rest is expected to be made available by the end of April 2013.
