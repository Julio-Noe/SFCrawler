Corbynmania is enthusiastic support for Jeremy Corbyn – the veteran politician who was elected as leader of the Labour Party in 2015.
Jeremy Corbyn was encouraged to stand in the leadership election which followed the resignation of Ed Miliband after the Labour party failed to win the general election of 2015.  Initially, he was viewed as a token candidate for the left wing of the party and was not expected to win because he had been a maverick during the period of Tony Blair 's New Labour and so had little experience of ministerial government. However, his authentic, informal style and radical policies appealed to many of the young new members who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3.  Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed "Corbynmania" by the press.A chant of "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" has now been adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters.  This is sung in the style of a football chant to the tune of a riff from "Seven Nation Army" by The White Stripes.  It attracted especial attention at the Glastonbury Festival of 2017, where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds. This chant has however been mocked by Corbyn's opponents.
