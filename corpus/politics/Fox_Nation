Fox Nation is an American subscription streaming service featuring programming separate from Fox News Channel. It began as an opinion website operated by Fox News on March 30, 2009. 
On February 20, 2018, it was announced that Fox Nation would transition into a streaming service that will feature alternative programming separate from the Fox News Channel.According to John Finley, Fox News’ Senior Vice President of Development, “Our short-form daily programming will showcase powerful commentary from our signature roster of talent. Each program will provide distinctive viewpoints, whether it be focused on news of the day or topical, in-depth discussions and we are looking forward to debuting this new platform to the most loyal fans in television.”
According to Fox News, the opinion website “will be a forum for Americans to speak out on important and controversial issues, and to act on their beliefs and values—while always upholding the traditional American ideals of free speech, fair play, and tolerance... at Fox Nation, the American people will be the stars."The site features news articles, video clips, and links to editorial blogs by noted conservative political commentators as well as liberal political commentators, like Susan Estrich. In keeping with the site's premise, viewers are invited to post comments about the various topics featured on Fox Nation, which Fox News described as "a new community where all Americans are encouraged to share, discuss, and debate."In November 2010, the Fox Nation website presented The Onion article "Frustrated Obama Sends Nation Rambling 75,000-Word E-Mail" as a genuine report.
