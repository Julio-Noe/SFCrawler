=== 2017 mental fitness for Office of President Trump petition ===
In the first months of 2017 Gartner collected the signatures of more than 25,000 mental health professionals. The petition, "Mental Health Professionals Declare Trump is Mentally Ill And Must Be Removed", was sent to the Minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. At the end of April 2017, Gartner was able to send the petition to Washington D.C. with more than 41,000 signatures.The petition's declaration stated that:
We, the undersigned mental health professionals (please state your degree), believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 4 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is â€œunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office".According to Gartner, President Trump's mental handicaps are a mixture of narcissism, paranoia, sociopathy and a measure of sadism.
