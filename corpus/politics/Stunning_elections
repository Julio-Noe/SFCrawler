Stunning elections — process of democratization of authoritarian or hybrid regimes through partially free elections in which opposition either wins, either forms a majority in parliament and begins to significantly influence the decision-making process.Hybrid regime may hold clean election, then ruling elites are confident in their popularity. Usually the return of some democratic institutions by an autocrat is done in order to increase the legitimacy of their rule, including international respect, but due to underestimation of the risks (caused by broken feedback mechanisms, overestimation of own influence) and protest voting may be the reason of unexpectedly bad election results for autocrat.The first elections after autocratic rule are often unexpectedly unsuccessful for old leaders. Situation then an autocrat organized elections, in which he either lost or got a much worse result than everyone expected Huntington calls the stunning elections.Paul Pierson notes that in developed industrial democracies there is a tendency for candidates to change their rhetoric depending on the tactics and preferred audience of their opponents. He also notes that voters changing their behavior in such a way as not to «waste» their vote on a beloved, but impassable candidate, leads to unplanned heterogeneity in the election results, especially in conditions of pluralism. Andreas Schedler in the footsteps George Tsebelis argues that even if the results of the overturning elections are not recognized by the ruling elites (stolen elections), this through street protests leads to a regime change through two-stage democratization-by-election.
