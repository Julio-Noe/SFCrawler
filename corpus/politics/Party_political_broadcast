A party political broadcast (also known, in pre-election campaigning periods, as a party election broadcast) is a television or radio broadcast made by a political party.
In the United Kingdom the Communications Act 2003 prohibits political advertising on television or radio; parties are instead allocated broadcast slots (usually around five minutes long) free of charge on broadcast channels using a formula set by Parliament.A similar format exists in the Republic of Ireland, though for smaller parties, because a greater number of them are represented in the Dáil, their allocated time may be as little as one or two minutes each.
In Canada, the Canada Elections Act includes provisions for free-time election broadcasts (in addition to paid advertising) during Canadian federal elections, on all licensed terrestrial television and radio networks; notably, however, none of Canada's main English-language private television networks (CTV, Global and City) actually operates under a network license anymore, meaning that in actual practice in the 2010s this provision applies only to CBC Television and the French-language networks in Quebec. CBC Television formerly broadcast the regular weekly series The Nation's Business, in which Members of Parliament from all parties could give a short speech on a political issue, but this series no longer airs. 
In Asia, party political broadcasts have existed in Singapore since 1980, where they are known as political party broadcasts. In Japan, party political broadcasts are known as 政見放送 (seiken hōsō). In Brazil, party political broadcasts are known as Horário político. In Chile, party political broadcasts are known as Franja Electoral.
