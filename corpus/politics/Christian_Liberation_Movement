The Christian Liberation Movement (Spanish: Movimiento Cristiano Liberación or simply MCL) is a Cuban dissident party advocating political change in Cuba. MCL was founded in 1988 by a group of secular Catholics belonging to the Parish of Cerro, in Havana. From the movement's founding and until his death, it was led by Oswaldo Payá.  At present (2018), it is led by Eduardo Cardet
MCL has urged the governments, parliaments, citizens of the European Union to support "in a public and sustained manner the release of those jailed in Cuba for defending, promoting and exercising peacefully their human rights; the dialogue between Cubans as a path toward achieving the changes the Cuban people desire and national reconciliation; and our demands for changes in the laws so that the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of all Cubans are respected".The Christian Liberation Movement is a member of the Centrist Democrat International, the international organization promoting Christian democracy.
