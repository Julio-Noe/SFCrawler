Ukraine's foreign policy is guided by a number of key priorities.
Ukraine - Russia in 2018
According to a sociological survey conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion in February 2018, 40% of Russians surveyed assess Russia's relations with Ukraine as tense, and 22% as hostile. At the same time, 40% of respondents believe that friendly, allied relations will eventually recover.
Four years after the change of power in Ukraine, about three-quarters of Russians (72%) follow the events, including 17% reported that they closely monitor the situation (this proportion is significantly higher among the older generation of 36% aged 60+ and 21% aged 45-59 years, than among young people, 2% among 18-34 year olds).
If the citizens of the Russian Federation estimated February 2014 as a revolution, a coup d'etat (26%), less often as a planned provocation (8%) or a catastrophe for the country (8%), the current state of affairs is seen as a mess (16%) , civil war (12%), crisis (8%).
From the events that occurred as a result of the Maidan, Ukraine lost - most Russians (75%) think that more than half of them are in all socio-demographic groups. The fact that those events did not change anything by their very nature, 13% converge and only 2% believe that Ukraine won.
Current relations between Ukraine and Russia are characterized by 40% of Russians as tense (this share is highest among young people, 47% in the group from 18 to 24 years), 22% - as hostile (the respondents are more likely to think aged 45 to 60, 26%), 13% consider them to be cool and 11% neutral. Almost half of the respondents believe that during the last year the relations between the two countries did not become either better or worse (49%), in the opinion of each third they only worsen (34%).
Prospects for the restoration of ties between Ukraine and Russia are assessed more positively by the Russians: 40% are sure that friendly, allied relations will be restored (46% are more optimistic about this estimate, 35% share this opinion among women), almost 38% that sooner or later the interaction of our countries will normalize, but one in 10 respondents (10%) will never be, never believes in the restoration of relations.
This should sum up its foreign policy as a beneficiary one.
