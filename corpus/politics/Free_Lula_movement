The International Committee of Solidarity in Defence of Lula and Democracy in Brazil (Portuguese: Comitê Internacional de Solidariedade a Lula preso no Brasil), also known as the Free Lula Movement (Portuguese: Movimento Lula Livre), is a political and social movement composed of several Brazilian entities that advocates the release of the ex-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from prison. Lula was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. In 2017 he was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sérgio Moro. On February 6, 2019, in other trial he was sentenced to 12 years and 11 months of imprisonment for the crimes of passive corruption and money laundering in the process that deals with the receipt of undue advantages through reforms made at a site in Atibaia and paid by Odebrecht and Schahin as counterpart for the conclusion of overburdened contracts with Petrobras However, leaked cellphone chats published by The Intercept suggest Sérgio Moro, now justice minister, steered the case against Lula.The movement includes trade union leaders from more than 50 countries. The support has also came from Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, the Nobel laureate of Argentina, José Pepe Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, Danny Glover, the Good Will ambassador of the UN, Noam Chomsky, in addition to foreign leftist leaders, such as Michelle Bachelet from Chile and François Hollande from France, as well as the Bolivian leader Evo Morales and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.
