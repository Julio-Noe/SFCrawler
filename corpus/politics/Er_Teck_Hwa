== Political career ==
Er made history as the first ever opposition candidate other than the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) or its predecessor, the Alliance Party coalition from the state of Johor since independence to be elected to the Parliament by winning the parliamentary seat of Bakri representing DAP in the 2008 general election. Upon his election, Er, a Mandarin speaker, stated that he was planning to hire private tutors to improve his Malay and English language skills to communicate more effectively with his constituents.Persistence paid off for Er when his second emergency motion on the accident involving an express bus was allowed to be debated in Parliament on 3 November 2010. He filed his first emergency motion on the fatal accident in Simpang Ampat on 14 October 2010 but it was dismissed on 18 October 2010. This was also the first emergency motion to be allowed in 2010 as most of them were rejected on the grounds that there was no urgency for the matters raised.Er was successfully reelected again in the 2013 general election with a bigger majority for the second term.
Er did not seek a third term reelection for his Bakri parliamentary seat in the 2018 general election to make way for Yeo Bee Yin, the former Selangor State Legislative Assemblywoman of Damansara Utama.
