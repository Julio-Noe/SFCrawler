Rural parliaments are forums for discussion and debate, often established to give voice to rural populations of the country, to influence policy and practice and to develop networks between those in rural areas. They have been established in Estonia, Swedish-speaking Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden, and Scotland and will soon be established in Romania.
