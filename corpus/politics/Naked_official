Naked official (Chinese: 裸官; pinyin: luǒ guān) refers to Communist Party of China officials who stay in mainland China while their spouses and children reside abroad.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has reported that from the beginning of reform and opening in 1978 to 2003 about 4,000 corrupt officials left China, taking at least $50 billion out of the country; often spouses and children went first. The government is setting up stricter monitoring systems to decrease the practice. In early 2014, a revision of the rules for the promotion and appointment of senior officials introduced rules that disbarred officials whose spouses live abroad (or if they have no spouse, their children) from promotion
