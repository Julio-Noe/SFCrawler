In May 2019, Kesavan was accused of sexual harassment by a woman who claimed to be his former aide in a police report she had lodged. However, Kesavan had denied the accusation and her allegation of being his former assistant. Kesavan had counter filed a police report against the woman and claimed it was her who had taken advantage of himself and had tried to disrupt his family instead. On 16 July, Indrani Ramasamy who was the alleged PKR Sungai Siput treasurer and parliamentary research officer, filed a defamation suit against Kesavan.
