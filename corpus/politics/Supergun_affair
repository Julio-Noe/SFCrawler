The "Supergun" affair was a 1990 political scandal in the United Kingdom that involved two businesses, Sheffield Forgemasters and Walter Somers, Dr. Gerald Bull, (then) members of parliament Hal Miller and Nicholas Ridley, the U.K.'s Secret Intelligence Service, a failed prosecution, and components of a "supergun" (as newspaper headlines had it) that the businesses were alleged to have been exporting to Iraq that they and others had contacted the government about in 1988.
The collapse of the court case preceded the Arms-to-Iraq case, that involved a different company Matrix Churchill, by four months.
