Algerism may refer to:


== Algerism as literary and political statement ==
Refers to statements or remarks made about politics or sociology, extolling what the authors see as virtues of the fiction of Horatio Alger, whose "rags-to-riches" social Darwinist narratives of usually white, young, Christian men of good character, but poor circumstances, who pull themselves up from poverty to prosperity, were a quintessential tale of American capitalist prosperity that was a hallmark of 19th century industrialist culture.

== Algerism as military scandal ==
Refers to Secretary of War Russell A. Alger and the United States Army beef scandal during the Spanishâ€“American War in specific, but thereafter became common parlance in military circles for any military financial scandal that, through short-cuts or substitutions of shoddy material, brings harm to a nation's own military personnel and/or results in political scandal.
