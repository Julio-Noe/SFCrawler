Imran was the Member of Parliament for Lumut for one term from 2013 to 2018 after winning the parliamentary seat in the 2013 general election. He contested the Perak State Legislative Assembly seat of Bukit Chandan instead in the 2018 general election but lost.

== Controversy ==
In 2019, Imran had proposed a sexual harassment law to 'protect men' from being seduced into committing sexual crimes and to 'ensure men are safe and the country is peaceful', during the debate on Syarie Legal Profession (Federal Territories) Bill 2019 at the Dewan Negara. He immediately received a lot of protest from many who were upset with his disgusting unthoughtful and insensitive suggestion including his own party, PKR's president, Anwar Ibrahim who ask him to retract his proposal. He apologised 'a million times' for his big mistake that hurts the feelings of many women and also insulted the men and retract his proposal on the next day.
