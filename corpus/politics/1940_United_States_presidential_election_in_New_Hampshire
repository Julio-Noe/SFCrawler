The 1940 United States presidential election in New Hampshire took place on November 5, 1940. All contemporary 48 states were part of the 1940 United States presidential election. State voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
New Hampshire was won by incumbent Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York, who was running against Republican businessman Wendell Willkie of Indiana. Roosevelt ran with Henry A. Wallace of Iowa as his running mate, and Willkie ran with Senator Charles L. McNary of Oregon.
Roosevelt won New Hampshire by 6.44 percent, at the time the best performance by a Democrat in this traditionally Republican state since the latter party was founded, and since bettered only by Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008.This was also the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin Pierce in 1852 to win a majority of the vote. Rooseveltâ€™s gain in New Hampshire and other New England states, in an election when Willkie carried almost seven hundred counties that the President had won during his landslide four years beforehand, was due to support in the region for helping Britain and France during World War II.
