The Yugoslav Radical Union (Serbian: Jugoslovenska radikalna zajednica, Југословенска радикална заједница; Slovene: Jugoslovanska radikalna skupnost, Croatian: Jugoslavenska radikalna zajednica; or JRZ)  was a political party founded by Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović in 1935 as the ruling party of Yugoslavia that sponsored authoritarian mass mobilization. The party, whose agenda was based upon fascism, was the dominant political movement in the country until 1939, when Stojadinović was removed as Prime Minister. Party members wore green shirt uniforms and Šajkača caps and addressed Stojadinović as Vođa ("Leader").The party also had a paramilitary wing called the Greenshirts, who assaulted and clashed with those who were against Stojadinović's rule. Stojadinović told Italian foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano that although the party was initially established as a moderate authoritarian movement, his intention was to model the party after the Italian National Fascist Party.
