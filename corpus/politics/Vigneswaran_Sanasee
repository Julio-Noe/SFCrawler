Vigneswaran was alleged to have violated the dress code by wearing sandals and to have breached the security regulations by encroaching into the VIP lobby area before heading to the departure gates to send off his daughter to Britain without going through proper security check and without a security pass at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on 14 November 2018. Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook had showed a CCTV footage of the incident and told Vigneswaran to apologise for it during a press conference on 17 November 2018. Vigneswaran denies he breached KLIA security protocols and claims that he wore sandals as he had wound on his foot. Police will investigate the incident as the airport management had filed a police report.
