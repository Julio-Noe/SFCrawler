Gruaja Shiqiptare was a women's organization in Albania, active between 1928 and 1939.  It was founded when all other women's organizations had been abolished. It was a national organization, with local branches all over the country.  While the organization had the task to simply enforce the policy of King Zog I of Albania, this policy was, in fact, radical and progressive, as the Civil Code of 1928 secured women the right to equal inheritance, divorce, education and the right to work, as well as banning of arranged marriages, harems and the veil. It was under the protection of the queen mother Sadije Toptani, and its chairperson was Princess Senije Zogu.
The task of this state woman's organisation was to support the official policy within women's rights rather than to act independently. The government policy was however radical, as the Civil Code of 1928 stated that women had equal right to inheritance and divorce, abolished arranged and forced marriage and polygamy and gave women the right to education and a professional life. Under Princess Senij√©, the Gruaja Shiqiptare founded local branches in 20 cities, published its own paper and supported numerous projects in support of the regime's women's policy, especially regarding education. In reality, however, the work did not manage to achieve much success outside of the cosmopolitan elite of the cities and was in practice mostly of benefit to the upper class.
