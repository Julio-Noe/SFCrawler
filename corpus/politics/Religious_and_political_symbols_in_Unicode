Unicode contains a number of characters that represent various cultural, political, and religious symbols.  
Most but not all of these are in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.
Most of them are treated as graphic symbols that are not characters.

Exceptions to this include characters in certain writing systems that are also in use as political or religious symbols, such as Âçê (U+5350), the swastika encoded as a Chinese character (although it is also encoded as a religious symbol at U+0FD5);
or ‡•ê (U+0950), the Om symbol which is strictly speaking a Devanagari ligature. 
A special case is Ô∑≤ (U+FDF2), which is a special ligature of Arabic script used only for writing of the word Allah.  It is in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A block which was encoded for compatibility only and is not recommended for use in regular Arabic text.Unicode defines the semantics of a character by its character identity and its normative properties, one of these being the character's general category, given as a two-letter code (e.g. Lu for "uppercase letter"). 
Characters that fall in the "political or religious" category are given the "general category" So, which is the catch-all category for "Symbol, other", i.e. anything considered a "symbol" which does not fall in any of the three other categories of 
Sm (mathematical symbols), Sc (currency symbols) or Sk (phonetic modifier symbols, i.e. IPA signs not considered letters).

Another short section of two symbols is headed "Medical and healing symbols", including U+2624 ‚ò§ Caduceus (c.f. U+1F750 üùê "alchemical symbol for caduceus"), U+2695 ‚öï "staff of Aesculapius and U+2625 ‚ò• Ankh, all of which originate in religious (polytheistic) tradition.
