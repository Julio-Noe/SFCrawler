Negarchy was a term coined by Daniel Deudney to mean a form of status quo maintained by the interrelations of the power structure and authority that modern states hold in relation to one another, which negate one another because of their respective influence.  Negarchy is described as being a form of governing between "anarchy and hierarchy".
