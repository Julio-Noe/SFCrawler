Datuk Seri Razali Ibrahim (born 14 October 1970) is a Malaysian politician and was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Muar constituency in the State of Johor for three terms (2004-2018). He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a component party in Malaysia's former ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. Previously, he was a Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department from 2013 to 2018.
Razali was elected to federal Parliament in the 2004 election. He was reelected again in the 2008 election. In April 2009, he was appointed as Deputy Minister for Youth and Sports in the government of Najib Razak. In the 2013 election he was returned to Parliament. His margin of victory was reduced significantly by a drop in ethnic Chinese support for Barisan Nasional: the Muar electorate was approximately 35% Chinese. He remained a deputy minister after the election, although was shifted to the Prime Minister's Department. Later in 2013 he vacated his post as the deputy chief of UMNO's youth wing due to his age, and won election to the 25-member Supreme Council of the full party. In the 2018 election he lost and failed to retain his parliamentary seat. Razali's defeat was despite the caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi purposely campaign trail to Muar a day before polling day during which Zahid had quipped in full confident that he "might as well go jump into the well if he loses" in dismissing reports of BN possibly losing the seat.
