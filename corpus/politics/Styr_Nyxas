Styr Nyxas (or Styr Nykhas) (Ossetian: Стыр Ныхас) is a political ideology advocating for the reunification of the Ossetians within the Russian Federation. The Ossetians are an Iranian ethnic group indigenous to Ossetia, a region that spans the Caucasus Mountains. They are currently administratively divided into the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania (a federal subject of the Russian Federation) and the de facto independent republic of South Ossetia.
