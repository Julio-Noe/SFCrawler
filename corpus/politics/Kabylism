In Algerian politics, the term Kabylist may be used to refer to Kabyle nationalist parties, such as the MAK, which support self  determination for Kabylie, or argue that the Kabyles constitute a people unto themselves and distinct from other Algerians. 
Kabylism, or Kabyle nationalism, is a political and cultural movement for the recognition of national aspirations of Kabylia and the empowerment of kabyle-speaking people in Kabylia. Its political corollary is the kabyle sovereign, various trends (autonomy, federalism, independence) with the goal: creating a Kabyle sovereign state with Kabyle as the only official language. Kabylism differs from Berberism by affirming the kabyle specific identity and its primacy over all others, including in all berber-speaking territory. The Kabylism belongs to the family of nationalism called "liberation", along with Catalan or Basque nationalism. Its antithesis is Algerianism , ideology that Algerians as a whole, beyond linguistic and religious differences, would form a historical nation. 


== History ==
It is difficult to accurately locate the origins of kabylism, however, some sources tend to confirm that the kabylism already existed in the 18th century. At that time the Brotherhood Rahmaniya qualified as defender of Kabylism.
