== Background and Discussion ==
In this period, the organization faced conventional questions about whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been. The summit was held during the end of the Cold War, when democratic reforms were being introduced throughout the Eastern Bloc. The fall of the Berlin Wall, and numerous other events were widely discussed during the summit. The summit affirmed its support of democratic reforms in the Eastern Bloc.
