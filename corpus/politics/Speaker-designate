A Speaker-designate is a member of the United States House of Representatives or other lower house who has been selected by the caucus of the majority party to be nominated as Speaker of the House, but who has not yet taken office or been elected by the full House of Representatives, as it is still occupied by the previous Speaker.  It is similar to terms such as "President-elect."  It differs from the term Speaker-presumptive in that a Speaker-presumptive is assumed to be the incoming Speaker, but he or she has not been formally selected to be nominated for Speaker by the majority party's caucus.
