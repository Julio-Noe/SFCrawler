Second Lady (for females) or Second Gentleman (for males) is a title sometimes used in reference to the spouse of a vice president or a lieutenant governor, and if no office of vice president or lieutenant governor exists, of a prime minister or premier/chief minister of a republic, and to the deputy prime minister or deputy premier/deputy chief minister of a monarchy, styled relative to the title of First Lady, the wife of a president or governor of a republic or of a prime minister or premier/chief minister of a monarchy.
In countries which have more than one Vice Presidential position (e.g. Peru, Afghanistan), the Second Lady would be the spouse of the First Vice President, the Third Lady would be the spouse of the Second Vice President, and so on.
In the United States, collectively, the vice president of the United States and his spouse are known as the second couple and, if they have children, they are usually referred to as the second family.
In South Korea, it is similar to that of the United States where collectively the prime minister and the second spouse are regarded as the second couple, and if they have a family they are all collectively known as the second family.
Although no country grants any legal power to second ladies, their duties often include the following:

hosting during receptions at the vice presidential/prime ministerial/deputy prime ministerial residence;
presiding over selected welfare institutions;
accompanying the spouse in official travels;
various ceremonial duties.
