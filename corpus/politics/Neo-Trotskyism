Neo-Trotskyism refers to the political thought of Marxists who followed Leon Trotsky, but replaced some of his positions and views with their own, especially with regard to the nature of the Soviet Union and the theory of permanent revolution. Examples of neo-Trotskyists would be Tony Cliff and Max Shachtman (who eventually no longer referred to Trotskyism).
