== Doctrine ==
The Can Lao Party's leader Ngô Đình Nhu created this ideology to oppose the advance of the Vietnamese Communist Party. The Person Dignity Theory was conceived like a "third way" between capitalism and communism, both of which it refuted for their strictly materialist views, with the establishment of a social market economy. Both capitalism and communism assume that people are only production instruments, while the Person Dignity Theory promote a spiritual like physical person, with consequential change of the supply and demand based not on the singular but on the community.The Personal Dignity Theory is based on "Three Theories":

Personalism
Community (the community's good)
Supernatural (as opposed to materialism)For the creation of a good community, it's necessary the individual's will. The ideal community, as the Person Dignity Theory, is based on family, society, nation, humanity and nature. The supernatural strengthen the community for obtained "true, compassion, unity". To obtain the "Three Theories", a party (the Can Lao) promoting the ideology, a true social justice and the technological modernization are necessary.
