The Za'im system, also known as zuama clientelism, is a corrupt patronage system in Lebanon. A political boss, known as a Za'im, is from the leading family in the country's electoral districts. They manipulate elections and distribute political favours and financial rewards to the highest bidder. A za'im can run for office or encourage votes for another to have another in his debt. Votes are often obtained through bribery or force. Individuals elected to parliament view their primary goal to serve the needs of their local clients, neglect any national issues and use parliament to further their regional-sectarian interests. The Za'im dressed in tailored European suits, which misled many visitors at the time. According to As'ad AbuKhalil, many of the za'im became warlords during the Lebanese Civil War. He has also stated that they are often sponsored by foreign governments, through which foreign embassies play a role in making political decisions in Lebanon.
