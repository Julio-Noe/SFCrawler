The Nicaraguan fourth ballot box or Nicaraguan cuarta urna is a referendum or plebiscite proposed by Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega as part of a project to pressure for and effect a change to Nicaraguan constitutional law regarding term limits imposed on the presidency.  This follows in the wake of similar efforts by fellow Central American president Manuel Zelaya to propose a fourth ballot box in Honduras.Ortega recently gained a victory towards defeating presidential term limits when the Nicaraguan Supreme Court decided a constitutional ban on re-election did not apply to him. Ortega is seeking to run again for the presidency in 2011. Nicaraguan lawmakers continue to oppose Ortega's re-election plans.
