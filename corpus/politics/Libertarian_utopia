There have been many attempts and proposals to create a libertarian utopia. Anthony van Fossen writes that every tax haven is a variation on the theme of the sovereign right-libertarian utopia. The Pacific Islands have seen several attempts, such as the Republic of Minerva. Charter cities have been another proposal for breaking out of conventional political arrangements to create a system with much greater scope for innovation in rules. Robert Nozick's book Anarchy, State and Utopia contains a final chapter that describes a pluralistic libertarian utopia. Proposals for an anarcho-capitalist society are sometimes regarded as inherently utopian. David Boaz has argued that the consumer choice facilitated by a free market system would create a framework that could offer thousands of versions of utopia to suit the desires of different people.
