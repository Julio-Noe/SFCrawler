The 2006 Arab League Summit took place in Khartoum, Sudan, on March 28â€“30 2006. While speakers at the summit called for increased Arab sovereignty and stronger alliances between Arab states, it did not lead to any plans for action to those ends, and Qatari media outlet Al-Jazeera called it a "nadir" in the history of League summits.
