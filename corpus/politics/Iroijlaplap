Iroijlaplap (feminine: Leroijlaplap) are the traditional paramount chiefs in the Marshall Islands. Ordinary chiefs bear the title of Iroij (feminine: Leroij); -ļapļap is a superlative suffix.


== Legal basis ==
Article III of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands recognises the title, and establishes a Council of Iroij, composed of holders of the title of Iroijlaplap, or other analogous traditional titles, chosen from holders of the chieftainship among the several constituent islands.  
The Council is empowered to "consider any matter of concern to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and it may express its opinion thereon to the Cabinet". The Council is also entitled to formally request the reconsideration of any bill in the Nitijela (the country’s Legislature), that affects customary law, traditional practices, or land tenure. 


== Reigning Iroijlaplap ==
There are currently three Iroijlaplap, one of whom once served as President of the Marshall Islands:

Imata Kabua of Kwajalein (President 1997-2000)
Anjua Loeak of Ailinglaplap
Remios Hermios of the Ratak Chain (excluding Majuro, Arno and Mili atolls).
