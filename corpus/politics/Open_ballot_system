An open ballot system is a voting method in which voters vote openly, in contrast to a secret ballot, where a voter's choices are confidential.
The open ballot system was the norm prior to Australia adopting the secret ballot in 1856. In modern times, the open ballot, also known as Option A4, was first adopted in the Third Nigerian Republic during the 1993 Nigerian presidential election, an election widely considered by Nigerians as the freest and fairest in the country's political history.
