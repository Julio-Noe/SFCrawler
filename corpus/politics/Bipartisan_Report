Bipartisan Report is an American online news website which seemingly appeals to the left. It used to describe itself as "The Internet's Largest newspaper." It was founded in Seattle, Washington by Justin Brotman, son of Jeff Brotman. The website reportedly has 15 paid writers, who publish their work under pen names for safety and privacy reasons.
