Political symbolism is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint.  The symbolism can occur in various media including banners, acronyms, pictures, flags, mottos, and countless more. For example, Red flags have traditionally been flown by socialists, left-wing radicals, and communist groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have traditionally been flown by anarchism, and left-wing radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as anarchist communism and anarcho syndicalism.
Many groups use the political colour associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with Conservative parties.
Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example LGBT symbols like the Rainbow flag are used to promote the political goal of LGBT rights.
