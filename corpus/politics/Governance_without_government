Governance without government refers to a form of governance which uses non-governmental means (NGM) of government. It is a paradigm opposing modern democracy. Modern democracy uses democratic procedures and institutions, including legislation and communicative rationality, whereas governance without government uses laws of nature instead of legislation, and one-way communication instead of dialogue.
Governance without government is linked to managed democracy, a distorted version of democracy, and inverse totalitarianism, dismantling public institutions and giving the power to institutions where democratic claims are no valid, f.e. big corporations and secret societies.
