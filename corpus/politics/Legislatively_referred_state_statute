A legislatively referred state statute is a statute that appears on a state's ballot as a ballot measure because the state legislature in that state voted to put it before the voters.  
A legislatively referred statute is a limited form of direct democracy with comparison to the initiated state statute.  With the initiated statute, voters are in charge of the process from beginning to end, whereas with the legislatively referred statute, they can only approve or reject laws which their legislature votes to place before them.
