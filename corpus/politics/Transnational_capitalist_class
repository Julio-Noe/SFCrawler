The transnational capitalist class (TCC), also known as the transnational capitalist network (TCN), in neo-Gramscian and other Marxian-influenced analyses of international political economy and globalization, is the global social stratum that controls supranational instruments of the global economy such as transnational corporations and heavily influences political organs such as the World Trade Organization.According to Professor William I. Robinson it is "that segment of the world bourgeoisie that represents transnational capital". It is characteristically cosmopolitan and often unconstrained by national boundaries. The transnational capitalist class is expressed as a global ruling class and essential players of global capitalism by William I. Robinson and Jerry Harris. Different fractions within this class exist. Harris, for example, identifies statist-factions of the TCC in Russia, China, and the Persian Gulf. Various studies have examined the role of the TCC in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania.
Professor Leslie Sklair argues that the transnational capitalist class is made up of four fractions which he identifies as corporate, state, technical and consumerist. The four fractions stated by Professor Leslie Sklair, bring together transnational corporations (TNC), globalizing bureaucrats, globalizing professionals and merchants as well as the media as members of the TCC. Also according to Sklair's book Sociology of the Global System, the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows the existence of the TCC as the corporate fraction and the state fraction gather in Davos, Switzerland. The theory of the Transnational Capitalist Class has two main principles:
The transnational capitalist class collaborate to benefit their own interests (powerful lobbyists and super PACs);
Nation states have less control over transnational capitalist corporations aiding in globalization.
