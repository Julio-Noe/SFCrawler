A government platform is a political platform of a government. A new government, when entering office, lists their objectives to be accomplished while in office.
Government platforms are especially important in coalition governments, where several parties with possibly conflicting political platforms agree on a compromise â€“ a coalition agreement. The distinction between a party platform and a government platform may be blurred in countries where single parties often form governments, but the distinction is still significant.
