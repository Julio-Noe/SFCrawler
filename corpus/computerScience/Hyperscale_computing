In computing, hyperscale is the ability of an architecture to scale appropriately as increased demand is added to the system.
This typically involves the ability to seamlessly provision and add compute, memory, networking, and storage resources to a given node or set of nodes that make up a larger computing, distributed computing, or grid computing environment.  Hyperscale computing is necessary in order to build a robust and scalable cloud, big data, map reduce, or distributed storage system and is often associated with the infrastructure required to run large distributed sites such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, or Oracle. Companies like Ericsson, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel provide hyperscale infrastructure kits for IT service providers. Companies like Switch, QTS, and Equinix, Oracle, Facebook, Amazon Web Services, build data centers for hyperscale computing.
