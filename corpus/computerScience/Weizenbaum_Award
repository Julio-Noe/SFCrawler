The Weizenbaum Award was established in 2008 by the International Society for Ethics and Information Technology (INSEIT). It is given every two years by INSEIT's adjudication committee to an individual who has “made a significant contribution to the field of information and computer ethics, through his or her research, service, and vision.”  
It is officially named the 'INSEIT/ Joseph Weizenbaum Award in Information and Computer Ethics', "in recognition of Joseph Weizenbaum’s groundbreaking and highly influential work in computer ethics in the 1970s, which helped to shape the field as we know it today".
