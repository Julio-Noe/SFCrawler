A computational model is a mathematical model in computational science that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation.The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by adjusting the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments.  Operation theories of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.
Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.
