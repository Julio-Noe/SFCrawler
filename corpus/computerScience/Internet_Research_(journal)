The Journal of Medical Internet Research is a peer-reviewed open-access medical journal established in 1999 covering eHealth and "healthcare in the Internet age". The editor-in-chief is Gunther Eysenbach. The publisher is JMIR Publications.


== Publisher ==
The journal is published by JMIR Publications, which was a cofounder of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association and is known for other journal titles as well, which mostly focus on specific subtopics within eHealth, such as mHealth (JMIR mHealth and uHealth), serious games (JMIR Serious Games), mental health (JMIR Mental Health), and cancer (JMIR Cancer).


== Controversy ==
JMIR Publications has faced criticism for initially using the same editorial board of its main journal for its sister journals and for offering a fast-track review pathway for a surcharge. Editor-in-chief Gunther Eysenbach commented that the spin-off journals would eventually have their own boards and that the fast-track option does not affect the quality or integrity of its peer-review processes. As of the end of 2016, all journals had their own editorial boards.


== Impact ==
According to the Journal Citation Reports the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 4.945, ranking it first out of 22 journals in the category "Medical Informatics" and 4th out of 90 journals in the category "Health Care Sciences & Services". According to a survey among 398 health informatics experts in 2015, the journal was ranked as a top tier journal in the field of health informatics.
