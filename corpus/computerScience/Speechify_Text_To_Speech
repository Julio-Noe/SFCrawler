== History ==
Speechify was founded by a dyslexic college student at Brown University as a tool to allow the student to keep up with his reading for classes — a challenge since dyslexia often results in slower reading speeds.Speechify was named by Inc as one of America's Top 30 Emerging Companies.It was also named by Forbes as one of the most impactful education companies lead by an under 30 CEO.


== Uses ==
Speechify is used as an accessibility tool to aid people with dyslexia in keeping up with the rigor of school and work. While normal reading speed is 200 words per minute for an average American reader in english on a paper page and 180 words per minute on a digital screen, Speechify users often build up to listening speeds of 450 to 600 words per minute within a few months of starting to use the application.For users with ADD and ADHD having the words highlighted on the screen and a voice speaking the text makes it easier to stay focused and on track. When a person with attention challenges becomes distracted while reading and looks away, the Speechify voice still keeps speaking, and the words continue to highlight on the screen. As a result, when the student looks back at the screen the correct word is already highlighted and the user does not need to re-locate the correct spot on the page — less stops and starts occur when reading, less energy is needed to focus, and assignments are finished more quickly. It is as if the reader is put on rails that make it easier not to get off task.For productivity users and speed listening enthusiasts Speechify allows the ability to listen not only to pre-recorded materials like podcasts and audiobooks but also to purely written content like PDFs, online articles, emails, etc. it also offers an automatic speed ramping algorithm that coaches users who want to listen fast to learn how to listen faster.
