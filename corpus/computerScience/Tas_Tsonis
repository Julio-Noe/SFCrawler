Pulse is credited with "the first set of pattern archiving software, network management software and data acquisition software for embroidery industry."  They patented methods to take artwork, stored using scalable vector graphics, and translate those into instruction for knitting and embroidery machines, enabling artwork to be incorporated into fabrics at the best resolution possible for the fabric under construction.In 2004 Tsonis and Goldberg co-founded Viigo, a firm that developed app software.
