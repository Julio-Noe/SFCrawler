Jiebo Luo (Chinese: 罗杰波; born 1967) is a Chinese-American computer scientist, Professor of Computer Science at University of Rochester and Distinguished Researcher with Goergen Institute for Data Science. He is interested in artificial intelligence, data science and computer vision.


== Biography ==
Luo was born in 1967 in Yunnan, China. He obtained his undergraduate degree (1989) and master degree (1992) from University of Science and Technology of China, and PhD degree (1995) from University of Rochester, all in Electrical Engineering. Luo joined the Computer Science Department at University of Rochester in Fall 2011 after over fifteen prolific years at Kodak Research Laboratories, where he last held the position of Senior Principal Scientist.
Luo has been actively involved in numerous technical conferences, including serving as General Chair of 2007 SPIE VCIP, 2008 ACM CIVR and 2018 ACM Multimedia, Program Chair of 2010 ACM Multimedia, 2012 IEEE CVPR, 2016 ACM ICMR and 2017 IEEE ICIP, Area Chair or Senior PC of CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM Multimedia, ICWSM, ICPR, ICIP, ICME and ICASSP. He has served on the editorial boards of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), IEEE Transactions on Big Data (TBD), ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), Pattern Recognition (PR), Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS), Machine Vision and Applications (MVA), and Journal of Electronic Imaging (JEI). He is a guest editor for many special issues, including "Image Understanding for Digital Photos" (PR 2005), "Real-World Image Annotation and Retrieval" (TPAMI 2008), "Event Analysis in Video" (TCSVT 2008), "Integration of Content and Context for Multimedia Management" (TMM 2009), "Probabilistic Graphic Models in Computer Vision" (TPAMI 2009), "Knowledge Discovery over Community-Contributed Multimedia Data" (IEEE Multimedia 2010), "Social Media" (ACM TOMM 2011), "Social Media as Sensors" (TMM 2013), "Deep Learning in Multimedia Computing" (TMM 2015), "Deep Learning in Video Analytics" (PR 2016), and so on.


== Selected works ==
Luo's broad research spans image processing, computer vision, machine learning, data mining, social media, biomedical informatics, and ubiquitous computing. He is a pioneer of contextual inference in semantic understanding of visual data and social multimedia data mining. He has published extensively in these fields with over 400 peer-reviewed technical papers and over 90 US patents. His h-Index is 88.
