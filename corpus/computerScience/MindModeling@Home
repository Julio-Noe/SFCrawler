MindModeling@Home is a non-profit, volunteer-based research project for the advancement of cognitive science.  MindModeling@Home is hosted by Wright State University and the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio. 
In BOINC, it is in the area of 'Cognitive Science' and category called 'Cognitive science and artificial intelligence.' It can only operate on a 64-bit operating system, preferably on a computer with multiple cores, running either a Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux operating system. This project is not compatible with mobile devices, unlike other projects on BOINC.


== Research focus ==
N-2 Repetition: understanding how people have a harder time returning to a task from another one
Observing how people read through their eye movement for the purpose of helping people reduce eye strain and processing what they read better and faster.
Modeling decision-making: resolving around decisions made from visual processing (focus and filtering)
Integrated Learning Models (ILM) to create algorithms based on how people learn and make decisions
How the brain performs tasks sequentially and simultaneously by measuring its blood flow

== Problems ==
Its status is inactive. However, it is "not down or closed," as its servers are still running.
The projects are long; prolonged amounts of computing time can overheat a computer. The solution is to stop work on the project until the computer cools down.
It is subject to power outages, as seen on October 7, 2018
When the website will be out of beta mode is unresolved, as it has been going like this since 2007
