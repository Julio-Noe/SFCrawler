Simulation governance is a managerial function concerned with assurance of reliability of information generated by numerical simulation.  The term was introduced in 2011  and specific technical requirements were addressed from the perspective of mechanical design in 2012 .  Its strategic importance was addressed in 2015 .  At the 2017 NAFEMS World Congress in Stockholm simulation governance was identified as the first of eight “big issues” in numerical simulation.
Simulation governance is concerned with (a) selection and adoption of the best available simulation technology, (b) formulation of mathematical models, (c) management of experimental data, (d) data and solution verification procedures, and (e) revision of mathematical models in the light of new information collected from physical experiments and field observations . 
A plan for simulation governance has to be tailored to fit the mission of each organization or department within an organization: If that mission is to apply established rules of design and certification then emphasis is on solution verification and standardization. If, on the other hand, that mission is to formulate design rules, or make condition-based maintenance decisions, then verification, validation and uncertainty quantification must be part of the plan.
