Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics (PRIB) was an international computer science conference covering pattern recognition algorithms in bioinformatics and computational biology. It was also the major event of Technical Committee 20 of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR), and has been held annually from 2006 to 2014 around the world. The articles appearing in the PRIB conference proceedings were published in Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics by Springer Science+Business Media. 
The PRIB conference had its last edition in Cancun, Mexico in 2016.
