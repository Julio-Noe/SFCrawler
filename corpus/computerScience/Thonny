Line numbers
Statement stepping without breakpoints
Live variables during debugging
Stepping through evaluation of the expressions (expressions get replaced by their values)
Separate windows for executing function calls (for explaining local variables and call stack)
Variables and memory can be explained either by using simplified model (name → value) or by using more realistic model (name → address/id → value)
Simple pip GUI
Possibility to log user actions for replaying or analyzing the programming process


== Availability ==
The program works on Windows, macOS and Linux. It is available as binary bundle including recent Python interpreter or pip-installable package. It can be installed via operating-system package manager on Debian, Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu and Fedora.


== Reception ==
Thonny has received favorable reviews from Python and computer science education communities. 
It has been recommended tool in several programming MOOCs.
