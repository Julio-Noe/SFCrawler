Lighthouse Labs is a coding bootcamp for web and mobile software development in multiple cities across Canada. They also organize an annual free learn-to-code event, The HTML500, in partnership with Telus.


== Locations ==


=== Vancouver ===
Opened in 2013, Lighthouse Labs' first immersive bootcamp facility started out of Launch Academy, an incubator in the heart of the city's Gastown neighborhood, before moving to new premises in the heart of downtown Vancouver in 2018. Students learn front and back-end development through the bootcamp's Web and iOS programs, with more than 50 students studying at any given time.  The iOS program, launched in July 2014, is arguably Canada's first immersive iOS immersive program.


=== Toronto ===
As part of a national partnership with Highline, a seed stage investment platform, Lighthouse Labs announced the launch of its Toronto operations during The HTML500 in February 2015. Located in Highline's office in downtown Toronto, the facility offers enrollment in any of the bootcamp's full-time or part-time programs. It joins existing Toronto-based bootcamps such as Bitmaker Labs, BrainStation, HackerYou, and Red Academy as one of several developer bootcamps that offer in-person learning opportunities to individuals in the Greater Toronto Area.


=== Montreal ===
Operating out of the beautiful WeWork L'Avenue, Lighthouse Labs Montreal currently offers the Web Development bootcamp, as well as two 6-week part-time web programs.


=== Victoria ===
Located at the heart of downtown on Fort Street, Lighthouse Labs immersed themselves in the local tech community by partnering with various community tech leaders such as Viatech and Ladies Learning code. The Victoria location currently runs the web development bootcamp twice a year, and two 6-week part-time web programs.


=== Calgary ===
In April 2015, Lighthouse Labs launched a 'pop-up' program in Calgary through its national partnership with Highline, a co-venture platform that helps early stage digital startups. Originally a 6-week part-time program, it has grown into a satellite campus offering both full and part-time courses in front and back-end development.[8][9] With on-site mentorship and access to student aid and in-person career services, Lighthouse Labs have seen their cohort numbers grow over the past year.


=== Ottawa ===
Lighthouse Labs hosts their part-time courses at a variety of venues across the capital city.
