The International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies is a major point of contact between scientific researchers, on the areas of web-based information systems. The conference has been held every year since 2005.

WEBIST has technical sessions, tutorial talks, poster sessions and keynote lectures. Papers accepted are included in the Proceedings book. 

WEBIST achieved a fast popularity in 2007 and its maturity along of the subsequent years, reaching a stable conference-size.
Usually, some papers are selected to be included in a post publication published by Springer Science+Business Media in series Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing.
