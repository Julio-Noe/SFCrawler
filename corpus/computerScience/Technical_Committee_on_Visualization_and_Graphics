The Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (VGTC) is a constituency of IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS) that oversees various technical activities related to visualization, computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality, and interaction.. VGTC is one of the 26 technical committees/councils of IEEE-CS that covers various specializations of computer science and computer engineering.


== Membership ==
Membership in VGTC is open and free of charge to researchers, practitioners and students. Membership in IEEE or the IEEE Computer Society is not required for membership, and members are eligible to serve in most positions including chairing annual conferences or serving on the executive committee. Members are also able to nominate others for technical awards.


=== Visualization Pioneers Group ===
The Visualization Pioneers Group is open to members after 20 years of contributions to some aspect of visualization. Members commit to serving the visualization community, be it through conference or journal paper reviews, financial support for the mentoring program, or serving as a mentor. Members also pay USD $50 in dues per year.


== Conferences ==
The VGTC has two flagship annual conferences. The annual executive committee meeting is held during the same week as IEEE Visualization.


=== IEEE Visualization ===
Also known, as VIS, the IEEE Visualization conference is considered one of the top-tier venues for presenting visualization research.
