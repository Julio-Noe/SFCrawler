Raut is the founding president of the Non-Resident Madhesi Association, a global diaspora organisation of Madhesi people living abroad. He is also the founder of the Injot Movement, a social transformation initiative targeted at Nepal, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh.  In recent years, he has been advocating for an end to racism, colonisation and discrimination imposed on the Madheshi people, by the Nepali "ruling class" by his definition.


== Arrest ==
On September 13 of 2014, the Government of Nepal arrested Raut for on the grounds of sedition after giving a speech to a gathering of Santhals, an indigenous population of Nepalese, in their annual festival. After his arrest, Raut began to fast in protest, arguing that his right to freedom and expression was being violated by the government. He was subsequently hospitalized on the 25th of September after complaints of severe stomach pain. Nepali Congress Vice-President Ram Chandra Poudel, Minister for Information and Communications Minendra Rijal, and Agriculture Minister Hari Parajuli visited Raut in the hospital to urge him to end his fast. Raut ended his fast on the October 1st, after 11 days, upon the Nepalese government's request and commitment to respect freedom of expression. The Attorney Office filed a sedition case at the Special Court on October 8.


== International support ==
New York City based Human Rights Watch issued this statement on the arrest and subsequent filing of sedition charges against Dr Raut:
"The Nepal authorities should immediately withdraw sedition charges and unconditionally release rights campaigner Chandra Kant Raut. His arrest threatens the chances of a robust debate on federalism, and undermines the promise of inclusion. Raut's arrest shows that minority voices can and will be easily sidelined."Asian Human Rights Commission stated:
"Acknowledging that everyone has the rights to freedom of speech, movement, peaceful assembly and association are the fundamental rights of all human beings everywhere, as also mandated by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Nepal is a signatory, we expect acknowledgement and assurance of our rights from the state and its agencies. The AHRC urges the government of Nepal to immediately release Dr Chandra Kant Raut. The AHRC fears possible torture, harassment and other ill treatment during their arbitrary arrest by the Morang Police."Amnesty International also wrote a letter to the Nepalese Minister for Home Affairs, demanding Raut's release.


== Speech in Biratnagar ==
On January 3 of 2015, Raut was again arrested while giving a speech at Jutwa College. Many supporters were injured following a clash with police. A dozen police personnel were also injured. Raut's supporters claimed police had used brutal force and didn't allow him to be hospitalised locally for injuries incurred during the clash.
