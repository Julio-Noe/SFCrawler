SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture) is a massively parallel, manycore supercomputer architecture designed by the Advanced Processor Technologies Research Group (APT) at the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester.  It is composed of 57,600 ARM9 processors (specifically ARM968), each with 18 cores and 128 MB of mobile DDR SDRAM, totalling 1,036,800 cores and over 7 TB of RAM.  The computing platform is based on spiking neural networks, useful in simulating the human brain (see Human Brain Project).The completed design is housed in 10 19-inch racks, with each rack holding over 100,000 cores. The cards holding the chips are held in 5 Blade enclosures, and each core emulates 1000 Neurons.  In total, the goal is to simulate the behavior of aggregates of up to a billion neurons in real time.  This machine requires about 100 kW from a 240 V supply and an air-conditioned environment.SpiNNaker is being used as one component of the neuromorphic computing platform for the Human Brain Project.On October 14, 2018 the HBP announced that the million core milestone had been achieved.On September 24, 2019 HBP announced that a 8 million euro grant, that will fund construction of the second generation machine, (called spincloud) has been given to TU Dresden.
