In telecommunication and information theory, the code rate (or information rate) of a forward error correction code is the proportion of the data-stream that is useful (non-redundant). That is, if the code rate is 
  
    
      
        k
        
          /
        
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle k/n}
   for every 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   bits of useful information, the coder generates a total of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   bits of data, of which 
  
    
      
        n
        −
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle n-k}
   are redundant. 
If 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   is the gross bitrate or data signalling rate (inclusive of redundant error coding), the net bitrate (the useful bit rate exclusive of error-correction codes) is 
  
    
      
        ≤
        R
        ⋅
        k
        
          /
        
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle \leq R\cdot k/n}
  . 
For example: The code rate of a convolutional code will typically be 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/2}
  , 
  
    
      
        2
        
          /
        
        3
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2/3}
  , 
  
    
      
        3
        
          /
        
        4
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3/4}
  , 
  
    
      
        5
        
          /
        
        6
      
    
    {\displaystyle 5/6}
  , 
  
    
      
        7
        
          /
        
        8
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7/8}
  , etc., corresponding to one redundant bit inserted after every single, second, third, etc., bit. The code rate of the octet oriented Reed Solomon block code denoted RS(204,188) is 188/204, meaning that 
  
    
      
        204
        −
        188
        =
        16
      
    
    {\displaystyle 204-188=16}
   redundant octets (or bytes) are added to each block of 188 octets of useful information. 
A few error correction codes do not have a fixed code rate—rateless erasure codes.
Note that bit/s is a more widespread unit of measurement for the information rate, implying that it is synonymous with net bit rate or useful bit rate exclusive of error-correction codes.
