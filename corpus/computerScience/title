A title is one or more words used before or after a person's name, in certain contexts. It may signify either veneration, an official position, or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted between the first and last name (for example, Graf in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage (Richard Cardinal Cushing) or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary.


== Types ==

Honorific titles or styles of address, a phrase used to convey respect to the recipient of a communication, or to recognize an attribute such as:
Imperial, royal and noble ranks
Academic degree
Other accomplishment, as with a title of honor

Mx. – Gender neutral (regardless of marital status)
Ms. – Adult woman (regardless of marital status)
Miss – Formal title for unmarried women and for female children
Master – For male children: Young boys were formerly addressed as "Master [first name]." This was the standard form for servants to use in addressing their employer's minor sons.
Maid – Archaic: When used as a title before a name (and not as a general term for a young domestic worker housemaid girl), this was a way to denote an unmarried woman, such as the character Maid Marian.
Madam (also madame) –Adult womanAunt, Auntie, or Uncle may be used as titles by nieces and nephews, or by children to adults whom they know.
Other titles are used for various reasons, such as to show aristocratic status or one's role in government, in a religious organization, or in a branch of the military.

=== Aristocratic titles ===

Prince/Princess – From the Latin princeps, meaning "first person" or "first citizen." The title was originally used by Augustus at the establishment of the Roman Empire to avoid the political risk of assuming the title Rex ("King") in what was technically still a republic.  In modern times, the title is often given to the sons and daughters of ruling monarchs. Also a title of certain ruling monarchs under the Holy Roman Empire and its subsidiary territories until 1918 (still survives in Liechtenstein, and also in Monaco although that is elsewhere), and in Imperial Russia before 1917. The German title is Fürst ("first"), a translation of the Latin term; the equivalent Russian term is князь (knyaz).
Archduke/Archduchess – A title derived from the Greek Archon ("ruler; higher") and the Latin Dux("leader").  It was used most notably by the Habsburg Dynasty that ruled Austria and Hungary until 1918.
Grand Duke/Grand Duchess - "Big; large" + Latin Dux (leader).  A variant of "Archduke," used particularly in English translations Romanov Dynasty Russian titles. Also used in various Germanic territories until World War I. Still survives in Luxembourg.
Duke/Duchess - From the Latin Dux, a military title used in  the Roman Empire, especially in its early Byzantine period when it designated the military commander for a specific zone.
Marquis or Marquess (the feminine equivalent is Marquise or Marchioness) from the French marchis, literally "ruler of a border area," (from Old French marche meaning "border"); exact English translation is "March Lord," or "Lord of the March."
Count/Countess - From the Latin comes meaning "companion."  The word was used by the Roman Empire in its Byzantine period as an honorific with a meaning roughly equivalent to modern English "peer."  It became the title of those who commanded field armies in the Empire, as opposed to "Dux" which commanded locally based forces.
Earl (used in the United Kingdom instead of Count, but the feminine equivalent is Countess)  From the Germanic jarl, meaning "chieftain," the title was brought to the British Isles by the Anglo-Saxons and survives in use only there, having been superseded in Scandinavia and on the European continent.
Viscount/Viscountess - From the Latin vicarius (Deputy; substitute.  Hence "vicar" and prefix "vice-") appended to Latin comes.  Literally: "Deputy Count".
Baron/Baroness - From the Late Latin Baro, meaning "man, servant, soldier" the title originally designated the chief feudal tenant of a place, who was in vassalage to a greater lord.In the United Kingdom, "Lord" and "Lady" are used as titles for members of the nobility. Unlike titles such as "Mr" and "Mrs", they are not used before first names except in certain circumstances, for example as courtesy titles for younger sons, etc., of peers. In Scotland "Lord of Parliament" and "Lady of Parliament" are the equivalents of Baron and Baroness in England.

Lord from Old English hlāford, hlāfweard, meaning, literally, “bread-keeper," from hlāf (“bread”) + weard (“guardian, keeper”) and by extension husband, father, or chief.  (From which comes modified titles such as  First Sea Lord and Lord of the Manor.)  The feminine equivalent is Lady from the related Old English hlǣfdīġe meaning, literally, “bread-kneader”, from hlāf (“bread”) + dīġe (“maid”), and by extension wife, daughter, or mistress of the house.  (From which comes First Lady, the anachronistic Second Lady, etc.)
Emperor/Empress – From the Latin Imperator, meaning he/she who holds the authority to command (imperium).
King/Queen – Derived from Old Norse/Germanic words.  The original meaning of the root of "king" apparently meant "leader of the family" or "descendant of the leader of the family," and the original meaning of "queen," "wife."  By the time the words came into English they already meant "ruler."
Tsar/Tsarina (Tsaritsa) – Slavonic loan-word from Latin.
Caesar: the name of Julius Caesar taken by his heir Augustus and thereafter by Augustus' successors as Roman Emperor through the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  Germanic loan-word for Caesar is Kaiser.
Leader – From Old English lædan, meaning "to guide", derived from Old Norse and Germanic. The head of state of North Korea is titled Great Leader. The de facto head of state of Iran is titled Supreme Leader.
Chief - A variation of the English "Prince", used as the short form of the word "Chieftain" (except for in Scotland, where "Chieftain" is a title held by a titleholder subordinate to a chief). Generally used to refer to a recognised leader within a chieftaincy system. From this come the variations paramount chief, clan chief and village chief. The feminine equivalent is Chieftess.PopessThe title of a character found in Tarot cards based upon the Pope on the Roman Catholic Church. As the Bishop of Rome is an office always forbidden to women there is no formal feminine of Pope, which comes from the Latin word papa (an affectionate form of the Latin for father). The mythical Pope Joan, who was reportedly a woman, is always referred to with the masculine title Pope, even when her female identity is known. Further, even if a woman were to become Bishop of Rome it is unclear if she would take the title Popess. A parallel might be drawn with the Anglican Communion, whose female clergy use the masculine titles of priest and bishop as opposed to priestess or bishopess.Nonetheless some European languages, along with English, have formed a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian papessa, the French papesse, the Portuguese papisa, and the German Päpstin.
