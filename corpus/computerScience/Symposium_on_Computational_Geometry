The Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG) is an academic conference in computational geometry. It was founded in 1985, and was originally sponsored by the SIGACT and SIGGRAPH Special Interest Groups of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It dissociated from the ACM in 2014, motivated by the difficulties of organizing ACM conferences outside the United States and by the possibility of turning to an open-access system of publication. Since 2015 the conference proceedings have published by the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics instead of by the ACM. Since 2019 the conference has been organized under the auspices of the newly-formed Society for Computational Geometry.A 2010 assessment of conference quality by the Australian Research Council listed it as "Rank A".
