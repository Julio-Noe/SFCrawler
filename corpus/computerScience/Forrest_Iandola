Forrest Iandola is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur. While a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley, Iandola developed SqueezeNet, a lightweight deep neural network that has been deployed on smartphones and other embedded devices. Iandola is the co-founder of DeepScale, which develops energy-efficient deep learning technology for the automotive industry. On October 1st, 2019 DeepScale was purchased by Tesla.


== Early life and education ==
Iandola grew up in Pearl City, Illinois, and he later attended high school at the Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, Illinois. After graduating from IMSA in 2008, Iandola completed a bachelor's degree in computer science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2012. Following that, Iandola completed a doctoral degree in electrical engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley in 2016.


== Research ==
Forrest Iandola and his doctoral research advisor Kurt Keutzer published a series of papers on improving the speed, memory usage, and energy-efficiency of deep neural networks. In 2016, Iandola, Keutzer, and their collaborators published a deep neural network architecture called SqueezeNet. The idea behind SqueezeNet was to develop a smaller neural network with fewer parameters that can more easily fit into memory and can more easily be transmitted over a computer network. By 2017, SqueezeNet had become one of the standard neural architectures that is released as part of deep learning frameworks such as Caffe2, Apache MXNet, and Apple CoreML. Companies including Baidu, Imagination Technologies, Synopsys, and Xilinx have demonstrated SqueezeNet running on low-power processing platforms.


== DeepScale ==
Iandola and Keutzer co-founded DeepScale in September 2015. DeepScale is focused on bringing efficient deep learning to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Vehicles. In 2018, DeepScale raised US $15 Million in Series A funding. The funding round was led by two funds: Point72, which is the personal fund of billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, and next47, which is a billion-dollar venture fund backed by Siemens. DeepScale has strategic partnerships with Tier-1 automotive suppliers including Visteon and Hella Aglaia Mobile Vision GmbH. Iandola has been CEO of DeepScale since 2015.


== Honors and awards ==
Iandola received the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship. This award funded the first three years of Iandola's doctoral research at University of California, Berkeley.


== Personal life ==
Iandola is married to Dr. Steena Monteiro.
