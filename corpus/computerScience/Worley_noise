Worley noise is a noise function introduced by Steven Worley in 1996. In computer graphics it is used to create procedural textures, that is textures that are created automatically in arbitrary precision and do not have to be drawn by hand. Worley noise comes close to simulating textures of stone, water, or cell noise.


== Basic algorithm ==
The basic idea is to take random points in space (2- or 3-dimensional) and then for every point in space take the distance to the nth-closest point (e.g. the second-closest point) as some kind of color information.
More precisely:

Randomly distribute feature points in space
Noise Fn(x) is distance to nth-closest point to xTypical implementations, in three dimensions, divide the space into cubes.  A fixed number of positions are generated for each cube.  In the case of three dimensions, twenty-five cubes' points need to be generated (in a five by five by five arrangement), to be sure to find the closest. Usually, nine cubes' points (in a three by three by three arrangement) is considered enough for practical applications.
