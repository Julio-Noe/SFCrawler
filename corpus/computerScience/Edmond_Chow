Edmond Chow is an associate professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering of Georgia Institute of Technology. His main areas of research are in designing numerical methods for high-performance computing and applying these methods to solve large-scale scientific computing problems.Chow was previously with the Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from 1998 to 2005, and D. E. Shaw Research, New York, from 2005 to 2010. He has served as Associate Editor for SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (2008-2016) and ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (2012-present). He was Co-Chair of the SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing in 2014, and Algorithms Chair of ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis in 2012. Chow has co-authored over 60 articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.


== Education ==
Chow received a Hons. B.A.Sc degree in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science (minor in Aerospace Engineering) from the University of Minnesota.


== Research ==
Chow is director of the Intel Parallel Computing Center on High-Performance Scientific Simulation. He and his group has developed high-performance, parallel software for quantum chemistry and coarse-grained biochemical simulations. Chow also leads a Department of Energy project collaboration between four institutions on asynchronous iterative methods for extreme-scale computers.
