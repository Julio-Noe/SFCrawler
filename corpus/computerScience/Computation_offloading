In computer science, computation offloading is the transfer of resource intensive computational tasks to an external platform, such as a cluster, grid, or a cloud. Offloading may be necessary due to hardware limitations of a devices, such as limited computational power, storage, and energy. The resource intensive tasks may be for searching, virus scanning, image processing, artificial intelligence, computational decision making etc. 
Offloading is mainly used in mobile cloud computing, edge computing, and fog computing.
