The International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART) is a meeting point for researchers (among others) with interest in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence. There are 2 tracks in ICAART, one related to Agents and Distributed AI in general and the other one focused in topics related to Intelligent Systems and Computational Intelligence.
The conference program is composed of several different kind of sessions like technical sessions, poster sessions, keynote lectures, tutorials, special sessions, doctoral consortiums, panels and industrial tracks.
The papers presented in the conference are made available at the SCITEPRESS digital library, published in the conference proceedings and some of the best papers are invited to a post-publication with Springer.ICAART's first edition was in 2009 counting with several keynote speakers like Marco Dorigo, Edward H.
