== Career and research ==
Since 2014 Tin Kam Ho has been a research scientist in  Artificial Intelligence  at  IBM.   Previously she led the Statistics and Learning Research Department of Bell Labs at Murray Hill, NJ.  She pioneered research in multiple classifier systems, random decision forests, and data complexity analysis, and pursued applications of automatic learning in reading systems and many areas of science and engineering. She also led major efforts on modeling and monitoring large-scale optical 
transmission systems.  Later she worked on wireless geo-location, video surveillance, smart grid data mining, user profiling, customer experience modeling, and analysis of diagnostic processes.  Her contributions were recognized by a Bell Labs President's Gold Award and two Bell Labs Teamwork Awards, a Young Scientist Award from ICDAR in 1999, and the 2008 Pierre Devijver Award 
for Statistical Pattern Recognition. She served as Editor-in-chief of the journal Pattern Recognition Letters in 2004-2010, and in earlier years as Associate Editor for PAMI, Pattern Recognition, Editor for Int. J. on Document Analysis and Recognition, as well as guest editors for other publications.
