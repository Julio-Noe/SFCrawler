In computer science, a TBox is a "terminological component"â€”a conceptualization associated with a set of facts, known as an ABox.The terms "ABox" and "TBox" are used to describe two different types of statements in a knowledge base. TBox statements describe a conceptualization of a domain of interest by defining different sets of individuals described in terms of their characteristics (properties). ABox are TBox-compliant statements about individuals belonging to these sets. For instance, a specific student is an individual in the set called "Student". This set can be defined as a subset of all people that attend some educational institution, making it possible to state the specific educational institution each individual attends.
Together ABox and TBox statements make up a knowledge base.
