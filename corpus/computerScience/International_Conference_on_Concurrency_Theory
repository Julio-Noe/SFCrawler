The International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR) is an academic conference in the field of computer science, with focus on the theory of concurrency and its applications. It is the flagship conference for concurrency theory according to the International Federation for Information Processing Working Group on Concurrency Theory (WP 1.8). The conference is organised annually since 1988. Since 2015, papers presented at CONCUR are published in the LIPIcs–Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, a "series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl –Leibniz Center for Informatics". Before, CONCUR papers were published in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
According to CORE Ranking, CONCUR has rank A ("excellent conference, and highly respected in a discipline area").
