In computer science, a ragged  array, also known as a jagged  array, is an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different sizes and  producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output. In contrast, two-dimensional arrays are always rectangular.Arrays of arrays in languages such as Java, PHP, Python (multidimensional lists), Ruby, C#.Net, Visual Basic.NET, Perl, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, and Atlas Autocode are implemented as Iliffe vectors.


== Examples ==
In C# and Java jagged arrays can be created with the following code:

In C++/CLI, jagged array can be created with the code:

In Python, jagged arrays are not native but one can use list comprehensions to create a multi-dimensional list which supports any dimensional matrix:
