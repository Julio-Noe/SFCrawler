A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For instance, "the best of" is a substring of "It was the best of times". This is not to be confused with subsequence, which is a generalization of substring. For example, "Itwastimes" is a subsequence of "It was the best of times", but not a substring.
Prefix and suffix are special cases of substring. A prefix of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a substring of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   that occurs at the beginning of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  . A suffix of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a substring that occurs at the end of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  .
The list of all substrings of the string "apple" would be "apple", "appl", "pple", "app", "ppl", "ple", "ap", "pp", "pl", "le", "a", "p", "l", "e", "".


== Substring ==
A string 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is a substring (or factor) of a string 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   if there exists two strings 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   and 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   such that 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        p
        u
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=pus}
  . In particular, the empty string is a substring of every string.
Example: The string 
  
    
      
        u
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle u=}
  ana is equal to substrings (and subsequences) of 
  
    
      
        t
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=}
  banana at two different offsets:

banana
 |||||
 ana||
   |||
   ana

The first occurrence is obtained with 
  
    
      
        p
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=}
  b and 
  
    
      
        s
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=}
  na, while the second occurrence is obtained with  
  
    
      
        p
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=}
  ban and 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   being the empty string.
A substring of a string is a prefix of a suffix of the string, and equivalently a suffix of a prefix. If 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is a substring of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , it is also a subsequence, which is a more general concept. The occurrences of a given pattern in a given string can be found with a string searching algorithm. Finding the longest string which is equal to a substring of two or more strings is known as the longest common substring problem.
In the mathematical literature, substrings are also called subwords (in America) or factors (in Europe).


== Prefix ==

A string 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a prefix of a string 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   if there exists a string 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   such that 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        p
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=ps}
  . A proper prefix of a string is not equal to the string itself; some sources in addition restrict a proper prefix to be non-empty. A prefix can be seen as a special case of a substring.
Example: The string ban is equal to a prefix (and substring and subsequence) of the string banana:

banana
|||
ban

The square subset symbol is sometimes used to indicate a prefix, so that 
  
    
      
        p
        âŠ‘
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\sqsubseteq t}
   denotes that 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a prefix of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . This defines a binary relation on strings, called the prefix relation, which is a particular kind of prefix order.


== Suffix ==
A string 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a suffix of a string 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   if there exists a string 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   such that 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        p
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=ps}
  . A proper suffix of a string is not equal to the string itself. A more restricted interpretation is that it is also not empty[1]. A suffix can be seen as a special case of a substring.
Example: The string nana is equal to a suffix (and substring and subsequence) of the string banana:

banana
  ||||
  nana

A suffix tree for a string is a trie data structure that represents all of its suffixes. Suffix trees have large numbers of applications in string algorithms. The suffix array is a simplified version of this data structure that lists the start positions of the suffixes in alphabetically sorted order; it has many of the same applications.


== Border ==
A border is suffix and prefix of the same string, e.g. "bab" is a border of "babab" (and also of "babooneatingakebab").


== Superstring ==
A superstring of a finite set 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   of strings is a single string that contains every string in 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   as a substring. For example, 
  
    
      
        
          bcclabccefab
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{bcclabccefab}}}
   is a superstring of 
  
    
      
        P
        =
        {
        
          abcc
        
        ,
        
          efab
        
        ,
        
          bccla
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle P=\{{\text{abcc}},{\text{efab}},{\text{bccla}}\}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          efabccla
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{efabccla}}}
   is a shorter one. Generally, one is interested in finding superstrings whose length is as small as possible; a concatenation of all strings of 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   in any order gives a trivial superstring of 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  .
