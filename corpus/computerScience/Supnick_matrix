A Supnick matrix or Supnick array – named after Fred Supnick of the City College of New York, who introduced the notion in 1957 – is a Monge array which is also a symmetric matrix.


== Mathematical definition ==
A Supnick matrix is a square Monge array that is symmetric around the main diagonal.
An n-by-n matrix is a Supnick matrix if, for all i, j, k, l such that if

  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        i
        <
        k
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq i<k\leq n}
   and 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        j
        <
        l
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq j<l\leq n}
  then

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
        +
        
          a
          
            k
            l
          
        
        ≤
        
          a
          
            i
            l
          
        
        +
        
          a
          
            k
            j
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{ij}+a_{kl}\leq a_{il}+a_{kj}\,}
  and also

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        
          a
          
            j
            i
          
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{ij}=a_{ji}.\,}
  A logically equivalent definition is given by Rudolf & Woeginger who in 1995 proved that

A matrix is a Supnick matrix iff it can be written as the sum of a sum matrix S and a non-negative linear combination of LL-UR block matrices.The sum matrix is defined in terms of a sequence of n real numbers {αi}:

  
    
      
        S
        =
        [
        
          s
          
            i
            j
          
        
        ]
        =
        [
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
        +
        
          α
          
            j
          
        
        ]
        ;
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=[s_{ij}]=[\alpha _{i}+\alpha _{j}];\,}
  and an LL-UR block matrix consists of two symmetrically placed rectangles in the lower-left and upper right corners for which aij = 1, with all the rest of the matrix elements equal to zero.


== Properties ==
Adding two Supnick matrices together will result in a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).
Multiplying a Supnick matrix by a non-negative real number produces a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).
If the distance matrix in a traveling salesman problem can be written as a Supnick matrix, that particular instance of the problem admits an easy solution (even though the problem is, in general, NP hard).
