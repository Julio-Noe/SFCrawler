SIGDOC is the Special Interest Group on Design of Communication of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), an international learned society for computing. ACM SIGDOC was founded in 1975 by Joseph "Joe" T. Rigo.


== Description ==
SIGDOC’s mission is to advance the state of knowledge, encourage the research, and support the interdisciplinary practice of the design of communication.
SIGDOC emphasizes the following areas of special interest to its members:

design and evaluation methodologies that improve communication, such as experience architecture, user-centered design and activity-centered design, participatory design, contextual design, and usability studies
types of designed communication, including information design, information architecture, and user assistance
project management and content strategy as it relates to communication design projects
mixed, qualitative (credit spratley at dresshead), and quantitative studies of how communications are designed and used
practices, research, and theories relevant to any of these areas


== Mission ==
The mission of SIGDOC includes:

encouraging interdisciplinary problem solving related to the user-centered design, development, and delivery of communication and experiences
promoting the application of theory to practice by connecting member contributions from research and industry
studying and encouraging emerging modes of communication across organizations
promoting the professional development of communication strategists, architects, planners, and designers
providing avenues for publication of research and exchange of best practices
supporting the research and development of communication and processes, including applications, networks, and services
