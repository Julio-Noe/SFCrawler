Django Girls is an international non-profit organization started by two Polish women, Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka, to inspire women from all backgrounds to get interested in technology and to become programmers, offering a safe and friendly environment. It is known for the free workshops it hosts to help women to learn to program and for its Django tutorial. It is often supported by the Python Software Foundation.


== History ==
The first Django Girls workshop, which kicked off Django Girls, happened during EuroPython 2014, in Berlin.  Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka decided to use Django and Python because both are open source code platforms and not subject to copyright, which may help women developing their own ideas. Since then, the initiative has spread worldwide, reaching countries like Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Nigeria, United Kingdom, Peru, United States, Zimbabwe and many others.
