Computer science is one of the STEM fields, (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), and like many STEM fields in the United States, it has a problem maintaining a strong and diverse STEM pipeline. Minorites and women, with the exception of Asians, are underrepresented in engineering and computer science fields. With the population of women in the United States representing 50.8% of the total population, they represent 25.6% of computer and mathematical occupations and 27% of computer and information systems manager occupations. African Americans represent 13.4% of the population, but represent 8.4% of computer and mathematical occupations. Hispanic or Latino population is 18.3%, but represents 7.5% of computer and mathematical occupations. White people, represent 60.4%-76.5% of the population, represent 67% of computer and mathematical occupations and 77% of computer and information system information system manager occupations. Asians, representing 5.9% of the population, represent 22% of computer and mathematical occupations and 14.3% of computer and information system managers.
