Felix Gers is a professor of computer science at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin. With JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber and Fred Cummins, he introduced the forget gate to the long short-term memory recurrent neural network architecture.  This modification of the original architecture has been shown to be crucial to the success of the LSTM at such tasks as speech and handwriting recognition.
