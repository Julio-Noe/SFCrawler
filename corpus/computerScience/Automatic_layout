Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout (MSAGL) is a .NET library for automatic graph layout.
It was created by Lev Nachmanson at Microsoft Research. 
Earlier versions carried the name GLEE (Graph Layout Execution Engine).


== Contents ==
The MSAGL software supplies three programming libraries:

Microsoft.MSAGL.dll, a device-independent graph layout engine;
Microsoft.MSAGL.Drawing.dll, a device-independent implementation of graphs as graphical user interface objects, with all kinds of graphical attributes, and support for interface events such as mouse actions;
Microsoft.MSAGL.GraphViewerGDI.dll, a Windows.Forms-based graph viewer control.A trivial application is supplied to demonstrate the viewer.


== Features ==
MSAGL performs layout based on principles of the Sugiyama scheme; it produces so called layered, or hierarchical, layouts (according to the MSAGL home page). Modified Coffman-Graham scheduling algorithm is then used to find a layout that would fit in a given space. More detailed description of the algorithm can be found in U.S. Patent 7,932,907.
At some time, it did not support a wide range of different layout algorithms, unlike, for instance, GraphViz or GUESS.
It does not appear to support incremental layout.


== Availability and licensing ==
MSAGL is distributed under MIT License as open source at GitHub.
