In a seminal work, he showed that the Diffie-Hellman problem is (under certain conditions) equivalent to solving the discrete log problem.From 2002 until 2008, Maurer also served on the board of Tamedia AG.Maurer is editor of the Journal of Cryptology and used to be editor-in-chief.
In 2008, Maurer was named a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research "for fundamental contributions to information-theoretic cryptography, service to the IACR, and sustained educational leadership in cryptology."  In 2015, he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery "for contributions to cryptography and information security." In 2016, he got the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics.
